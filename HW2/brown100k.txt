the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlantas recent primary election produced no evidence that any irregularities took place
the jury further said in termend presentments that the city executive committee which had overall charge of the election deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta for the manner in which the election was conducted
the septemberoctober term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible irregularities in the hardfought primary which was won by mayornominate ivan allen jr
only a relative handful of such reports was received the jury said considering the widespread interest in the election the number of voters and the size of this city
the jury said it did find that many of georgias registration and election laws are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous
it recommended that fulton legislators act to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them
the grand jury commented on a number of other topics among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments
merger proposed
however the jury said it believes these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration
the city purchasing department the jury said is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies
it urged that the city take steps to remedy this problem
implementation of georgias automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury
it urged that the next legislature provide enabling funds and reset the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected
the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare departments handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes
this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program the jury said but the state welfare department has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county which receives none of this money
the jurors said they realize a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties
nevertheless we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds the jurors said
failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden on fulton taxpayers
the jury also commented on the fulton ordinarys court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation
wards protected
the jury said it found the court has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations of two previous grand juries the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee
these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the courts wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms the jury said
regarding atlantas new multimilliondollar airport the jury recommended that when the new management takes charge jan 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences
the jury did not elaborate but it added that there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable
ask jail deputies
on other matters the jury recommended that 1
four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and a doctor medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail
2
fulton legislators work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable pension plan for city employes
the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department the fulton tax commissioners office the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms grady hospital and the fulton health department

georgia republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governors race a top official said wednesday
robert snodgrass state gop chairman said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience
state party chairman james w dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held sept 8 in savannah at which newly elected texas sen john tower will be the featured speaker
in the blue ridge meeting the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters
despite the warning there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate according to republicans who attended
when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race it voted no and there were no dissents
the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race one of two alternative courses must be taken 1
five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot or 2
the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system a system which the party opposes in its platform
sam caldwell state highway department public relations director resigned tuesday to work for lt gov garland byrds campaign

the georgia legislature will wind up its 1961 session monday and head for home where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly
before adjournment monday afternoon the senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made
gov vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment
vandiver likely will mention the 100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item
construction bonds
meanwhile it was learned the state highway department is very near being ready to issue the first 30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds
the bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of georgias most heavily traveled highways
a highway department source said there also is a plan there to issue some 3 million to 4 million worth of rural roads authority bonds for rural road construction work
a revolving fund
the department apparently intends to make the rural roads authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities
vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of 50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then gov marvin griffin
the highway department source told the constitution however that vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds
schley county rep b d pelham will offer a resolution monday in the house to rescind the bodys action of friday in voting itself a 10 per day increase in expense allowances
pelham said sunday night there was research being done on whether the quickie vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought
while emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the house voted through 8731
a similar resolution passed in the senate by a vote of 295
as of sunday night there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action
pelham pointed out that georgia voters last november rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future legislature sessions
a veteran jackson county legislator will ask the georgia house monday to back federal aid to education something it has consistently opposed in the past
rep mac barber of commerce is asking the house in a privilege resolution to endorse increased federal support for public education provided that such funds be received and expended as state funds
barber who is in his 13th year as a legislator said there are some members of our congressional delegation in washington who would like to see it the resolution passed
but he added that none of georgias congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution
the resolution which barber tossed into the house hopper friday will be formally read monday
it says that in the event congress does provide this increase in federal funds the state board of education should be directed to give priority to teacher pay raises
colquitt
after a long hot controversy miller county has a new school superintendent elected as a policeman put it in the coolest election i ever saw in this county
the new school superintendent is harry davis a veteran agriculture teacher who defeated felix bush a school principal and chairman of the miller county democratic executive committee
davis received 1119 votes in saturdays election and bush got 402
ordinary carey williams armed with a pistol stood by at the polls to insure order
this was the coolest calmest election i ever saw colquitt policeman tom williams said
being at the polls was just like being at church
i didnt smell a drop of liquor and we didnt have a bit of trouble
the campaign leading to the election was not so quiet however
it was marked by controversy anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence
the former county school superintendent george p callan shot himself to death march 18 four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board
during the election campaign both candidates davis and bush reportedly received anonymous telephone calls
ordinary williams said he too was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election
many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls and williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election
sheriff felix tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise
everything went real smooth the sheriff said
there wasnt a bit of trouble

committee approval of gov price daniels abandoned property act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers
daniel personally led the fight for the measure which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation
under committee rules it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week
but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it
daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next aug 31
he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books since texas was a republic
it permits the state to take over bank accounts stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more
the bill which daniel said he drafted personally would force banks insurance firms pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer
the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property daniel declared
dewey lawrence a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers
if you destroy confidence in banks you do something to the economy he said
you take out of circulation many millions of dollars
rep charles e hughes of sherman sponsor of the bill said a failure to enact it would amount to making a gift out of the taxpayers pockets to banks insurance and pipeline companies
his contention was denied by several bankers including scott hudson of sherman gaynor b jones of houston j b brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin
cox argued that the bill is probably unconstitutional since he said it would impair contracts
he also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing since the bill was introduced only last monday

it would authorize the texas education agency to establish countywide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300000 or more population require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here
operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of dallas harris bexar tarrant and el paso would be 451500 which would be a savings of 157460 yearly after the first years capital outlay of 88000 was absorbed parkhouse told the senate
the tea estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in dallas county saving them from coming to austin to live in the state deaf school
dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between reps v e red berry and joe ratcliff
while details are still to be worked out ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in dallas why he thinks berrys proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected
were getting more pro letters than con on horse race betting said ratcliff
but i believe if people were better informed on this question most of them would oppose it also
im willing to stake my political career on it
rep berry an exgambler from san antonio got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies
a house committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report although the resolution faces hard sledding later
the house passed finally and sent to the senate a bill extending the state health departments authority to give planning assistance to cities
the senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of house bills approved by committees passing the three on the calendar
one validated acts of school districts
another enlarged authority of the beaumont navigation district
the third amended the enabling act for creation of the lamar county hospital district for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted
without dissent senators passed a bill by sen a r schwartz of galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the gulf coast district
money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the state hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site
two tax revision bills were passed
one by sen louis crump of san saba would aid more than 17000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized
instead retailers would sign a certificate of correctness violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison plus a 1000 fine
it was one of a series of recommendations by the texas research league
the other bill by sen a m aikin jr of paris would relieve real estate brokers who pay their own annual licensing fee from the 12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds
natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain under a bill by sen frank owen 3 of el paso to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas

under formbys plan an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor lieutenant governor speaker of the house attorney general and chief justice of the texas supreme court
austin texas
state representatives decided thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes texans would prefer to pay
an adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the state affairs committee a bill which would order the referendum on the april 4 ballot when texas votes on a us senator
rep wesley roberts of seminole sponsor of the poll idea said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill
the west texan reported that he had finally gotten chairman bill hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on feb 22
the proposal would have to receive final legislative approval by twothirds majorities before march 1 to be printed on the april 4 ballot roberts said
opponents generally argued that the ballot couldnt give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice
all dallas members voted with roberts except rep bill jones who was absent

paradise lost to the alleged water needs of texas big cities thursday
rep james cotten of weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the texas house of representatives was an effort by big cities like dallas and fort worth to cover up places like paradise a wise county hamlet of 250 people
when the shouting ended the bill passed 114 to 4 sending it to the senate where a similar proposal is being sponsored by sen george parkhouse of dallas
most of the fire was directed by cotten against dallas and sen parkhouse
the bill would increase from 5000000 to 15000000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project
cotten construed this as a veiled effort by parkhouse to help dallas and other large cities get money which cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural texas
statements by other legislators that dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill did not sway cottens attack
the bills defenders were mostly smalltown legislators like j w buchanan of dumas eligio kika de la garza of mission sam f collins of newton and joe chapman of sulphur springs
this is a poor boys bill said chapman
dallas and fort worth can vote bonds
this would help the little peanut districts
austin texas
a houston teacher now serving in the legislature proposed thursday a law reducing the time spent learning educational methods
rep henry c grover who teaches history in the houston public schools would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the socalled teaching methods courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate
a normal years work in college is 30 semester hours
grover also would require juniorsenior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching

a person with a masters degree in physics chemistry math or english yet who has not taken education courses is not permitted to teach in the public schools said grover
college teachers in texas are not required to have the education courses
fiftythree of the 150 representatives immediately joined grover as cosigners of the proposal

state and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a blue ribbon citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program
the report culminating a year long study of the adc program in cook county by a new york city welfare consulting firm listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring adc case load
the report called racial discrimination in employment one of the most serious causes of family breakdown desertion and adc dependency
must solve problem
the monthly cost of adc to more than 100000 recipients in the county is 44 million dollars said c virgil martin president of carson pirie scott co committee chairman
we must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon adc for subsistence martin said
the volume of adc cases will decrease martin reported when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color
these he said are two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to adc
calls for extension
other recommendations made by the committee are
extension of the adc program to all children in need living with any relatives including both parents as a means of preserving family unity
research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy
several defendants in the summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest judge james b parsons was told in criminal court yesterday
the disclosure by charles bellows chief defense counsel startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial
bellows made the disclosure when he asked judge parsons to grant his client alan clements 30 a separate trial
bellows made the request while the allwoman jury was out of the courtroom
fears prejudicial aspects
the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client bellows told the court
some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property
it is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others
judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this
yes your honor replied bellows
what this amounts to if true is that there will be a freeforall fight in this case
there is a conflict among the defendants
washington july 24
president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio
the president spent much of the weekend at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone
shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port mass a white house spokesman said the address text still had quite a way to go toward completion
decisions are made
asked to elaborate pierre salinger white house press secretary replied i would say its got to go thru several more drafts
salinger said the work president kennedy advisers and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated by russias demands and proposals for the city
the last 10 cases in the investigation of the nov 8 election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m karns who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally illegal means
karns said that the cases involved a matter of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence of the 50 persons
he said evidence was obtained in violation of the legal rights of citizens
karns ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases
in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been unable to make a case
contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by morris j wexler special prosecutor
issue jury subpoenas
wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building but did not take them before the grand jury
mayer goldberg attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward argued this procedure constituted intimidation
wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning
karns said it was a wrongful act for wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand jury room
he said this constituted a very serious misuse of the criminal court processes
actually the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook county altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court said karns who is a city judge in east st louis sitting in cook county court
faced seven cases
karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons
wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with complementary miscount of the vote in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another
the cases involved judges in the 33d 24th and 42d precincts of the 31st ward the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward the 18th precinct of the 4th ward and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward
the case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns
two other cases also were under advisement
claims precedent lacking
after reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed he would dismiss them
washington feb 9
president kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 142 million americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs
the president in a special message to congress tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools and expand child health care and general medical research
the aged care plan similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator a fight on capitol hill
it was defeated in congress last year
cost up to 37 a year
it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as 37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes
the social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent 3 per cent on each worker and employer on the first 4800 of pay per year
the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to 5000 a year and the payroll tax to 65 per cent 325 per cent each
similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system
the payroll tax would actually rise to 75 per cent starting jan 1 1963 if the plan is approved because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs
outlays would increase
officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 15 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year 1963
both figures would go higher in later years
other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years
these would be paid for out of general not payroll taxes
nursing home care
the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems 1
full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness except that the patient would pay 10 a day of the cost for the first nine days
2
full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital
a patient could receive up to 300 days paidfor nursing home care under a unit formula allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospitalcare credit
3
hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of 20 a patient
4
community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness
the president noted that congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged
calls proposal modest
he said his plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers expense but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings or those of their children caused by an extended hospital stay
this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs he said and with sufficient deductible requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals
this is not a program of socialized medicine
it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed
every person will choose his own doctor and hospital
wouldnt pay doctors
the plan does not cover doctor bills
they would still be paid by the patient
apart from the aged care plan the presidents most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools
the president said the nations 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care
moreover he said many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they cant afford the schooling costs
contributions to schools
the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to 1500 a year for onefourth of the first year students
the schools could use the money to pay 4year scholarships based on need of up to 2000 a year per student
in addition the government would pay a 1000 cost of education grant to the schools for each 1500 in scholarship grants
officials estimated the combined programs would cost 51 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966
the president recommended federal matching grants totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones
more for nursing homes
in the area of community health services the president called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction
he asked for another 10 million dollar initial appropriation for stimulatory grants to states to improve nursing homes
he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals
in the child health field the president said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the childrens bureau
he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute
asks research funds
the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation
he did not say by how much
for medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase from 30 to 50 millions in matching grants for building research facilities
the president said he will also propose increasing by an unspecified amount the 540 million dollars in the 196162 budget for direct government research in medicine
the president said his proposals combine the indispensable elements in a sound health program people knowledge services facilities and the means to pay for them
reaction as expected
congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines
legislators who last year opposed placing agedcare under the social security system criticized the presidents plan
those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message
senate republican leader dirksen ill and house republican leader charles halleck ind said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance
halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first
house speaker sam rayburn d tex called the kennedy program a mighty fine thing but made no prediction on its fate in the house

acting hastily under white house pressure the senate tonight confirmed robert c weaver as the nations federal housing chief
only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote
a number of scattered ayes and noes was heard
customary senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency
in the last eight years all presidential appointments including those of cabinet rank have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor
enforce by demand
the rule was enforced by demand of sen wayne morse d ore in connection with president eisenhowers cabinet selections in 1953 and president kennedys in 1961
oslo
the most positive element to emerge from the oslo meeting of north atlantic treaty organization foreign ministers has been the freer franker and wider discussions animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings
this has been a working session of an organization that by its very nature can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes
in oslo the ministers have met in a climate of candor and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one anothers problems
this atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the colonialist powers and those who have never or not for a long time had such problems
the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa exacerbated by the difficulties changes and tragedies facing them and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about has been conspicuous by its absence
explosion avoided
in the case of portugal which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the nato council should critics of its angola policy prove harsh there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension
the general remarkably courteous explanation has left basic positions unchanged but there has been no explosion in the council
there should even be no more bitter surprises in the un general assembly as to nato members votes since a new ad hoc nato committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as angola will be discussed in advance
canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the nato locomotive
even norway despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance is today closer to the nato line
on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the united states leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for
one diplomat described the tenor of secretary of state dean rusks speeches as inconclusive
but he hastened to add that if united states policies were not always clear despite mr rusks analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the west this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy
exploratory mood
a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair with no fewer than six soviet correspondents accredited
the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days despite mr rusks personal popularity that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots
the secretary of state himself in his first speech gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the united states that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months
but where the core of nato is concerned the secretary of state has not only reiterated the united states profound attachment to the alliance cornerstone of its foreign policy but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at natos disposal in european waters
the secretary of state has also solemnly repeated a warning to the soviet union that the united states will not stand for another setback in berlin an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole
conflict surveyed
the secretarys greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of nato realization that eastwest friction wherever it take place around the globe is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection
the annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions more deeper and more timely political consultation within the alliance the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development when ratified as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent
this increase in the threshold as the conventional forces strengthening is called will prove one of the alliances most difficult problems in the months to come
each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down but never completely fulfilled

the kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time
there is little optimism here that the communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in laos
the united states state department officials explain now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from being used as a base for communist attacks on neighboring thailand and south viet nam
they count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the geneva conference to achieve this
the united states hopes that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominated
but it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility
policies modified
the inclination here is to accept a de facto ceasefire in laos rather than continue to insist on a verification of the ceasefire by the international control commission before participating in the geneva conference
this is another of the modifications of policy on laos that the kennedy administration has felt compelled to make
it excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration
its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas
but with the months moving on and the immediate confrontations with the communists showing no gain for the free world the question arises
how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with communist aggression
former vicepresident richard m nixon in detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the soviet union
he was critical of what he feels is president kennedys tendency to be too conciliatory
gop restrained
it does not take a gallup poll to find out that most republicans in congress feel this understates the situation as republicans see it
they can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether republicans if they had been in power would have made amateurish and monumental blunders in cuba
one republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didnt attack the kennedy administration on this score
his reply he said was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now
but he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first
the republicans some weeks ago served notice through senator thruston b morton r of kentucky chairman of the republican national committee that the kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in laos was a coalition government susceptible of communist domination
kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 harvard boston university brandeis and massachusetts institute of technology educators
detente urged
this group pleads with the administration to give no further support for the invasion of cuba by exile groups
it recommends that the united states seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations
and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of latin america the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds
mr nixon for his part would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation
but he did recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist countries shipped any further arms to cuba that it would not be tolerated
until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victories in laos almost any observer would have said that president kennedy had blended a program that respected generally the opinions voiced both by mr nixon and the professors
aid plans revamped
very early in his administration he informed the kremlin through diplomatic channels a high official source disclosed that the new administration would react even tougher than the eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration
strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements
policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed
but thus far there has been no response in kind
foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations
in laos the administration looked at the eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into southeast asian waters as a useless gesture
again and again it asked the communists to freeze the military situation in laos
but the communists aided the pathet lao at an even faster rate
and after several correspondents went into pathet lao territory and exposed the huge buildup administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a great service and laid the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization
seato was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in laos
but the communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the united states to want to risk a limited or an allout war over laos
some seato nations disagreed however

there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that laos was ill suited to be an ally unlike its more determined neighbors thailand and south viet nam
the administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized laos
the prowestern government which the united states had helped in a revolt against the souvanna phouma neutralist government never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the royal lao army
there certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the united states would not back the prowestern government to the hilt
if the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma whom it felt was too trusting of communists it gradually had to relinquish them
one factor was the statement of senator j w fulbright d of arkansas chairman of the senate foreign relations committee
he declared on march 25 that the united states had erred a year and a half ago by encouraging the removal of prince souvanna
washington
the white house is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the united states
the president is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the vitality of the nation
in an important assertion of national leadership in this field he has issued an executive order establishing the presidents committee on juvenile delinquency and crime to be supported and assisted by a citizens advisory council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems
the president asks the support and cooperation of congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend
offenses multiply
the president has also called upon the attorney general the secretary of health education and welfare and the secretary of labor to coordinate their efforts in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem
simultaneously the president announced thursday the appointment of david l hackett a special assistant to the attorney general as executive director of the new committee on juvenile delinquency and youth crime
his sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948 each year showing an increase in offenders
among arrests reported by the federal bureau of investigation in 1959 about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age
east providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a fulltime director raymond h hawksley the present city cd head believes
mr hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council or anyone else locally to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time
east providence now has no civil defense program
mr hawksley the states general treasurer has been a parttime cd director in the city for the last nine years
he is not interested in being named a fulltime director
noting that president kennedy has handed the defense department the major responsibility for the nations civil defense program mr hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a fulltime local director
he expressed the opinion the city could hire a cd director for about 3500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs
mr hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the fulltime cd job
one of these men is former fire chief john a laughlin he said
along with a director the city should provide a cd headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized
mr hawksley said
one advantage that would come to the city in having a fulltime director he said is that east providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program
matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios sirens and rescue trucks he said
mr hawksley believes that east providence could use two more rescue trucks similar to the cd vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the central fire station
he would assign one of the rescue trucks to the riverside section of the city and the other to the rumford area
speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city mr hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack
the narragansett race track grounds is one assembly point he said and a drivein theater in seekonk would be another
riverside residents would go to the seekonk assembly point
mr hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack
such vital information he said has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know
if the city council fails to consider appointment of a fulltime cd director mr hawksley said then he plans to call a meeting early in september so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally
one of the first things he would do he said would be to organize classes in first aid
other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government
rhode island is going to examine its sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind
governor notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the general assembly
the governors move into the socalled blue law controversy came in the form of a letter to miss mary r grant deputy city clerk of central falls
a copy was released to the press
mr notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the central falls city council on july 10 and sent to the state house by miss grant
the resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature
while the city council suggested that the legislative council might perform the review mr notte said that instead he will take up the matter with atty gen j joseph nugent to get the benefit of his views
he will then appoint the study committee with mr nugents cooperation the governor said
i would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings mr notte said to obtain the views of the general public and religious labor and specialinterest groups affected by these laws
the governor wrote miss grant that he has been concerned for some time with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating sunday sales
the attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws
should there be evidence they are shirking he has said the state police will step into the situation
there has been more activity across the state line in massachusetts than in rhode island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the sunday sales laws
the statutes similar in both the bay state and rhode island and dating back in some instances to colonial times severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the sabbath
the central falls city council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on sunday
the only day they have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on sunday the councils resolution said
the small shops must be retained for they provide essential service to the community according to the resolution which added that they also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors
it declares that sunday sales licenses provide great revenue to the local government
the council advised the governor that large supermarkets factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business on sunday
they operate on a volume basis it was contended and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community
liberals and conservatives in both parties democratic and republican should divorce themselves and form two independent parties george h reama nationally known labormanagement expert said here yesterday
mr reama told the rotary club of providence at its luncheon at the sheratonbiltmore hotel that about half of the people in the country want the welfare type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system
he suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day
he said he was confessing that i was a member of the socialist party in 1910
that he added was when he was a very young man a machinist and toolmaker by trade
that was before i studied law
some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the socialist party
the lawyer with whom i studied law steered me off the socialist track
he steered me to the right track the free enterprise track
he said that when he was a socialist in 1910 the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources
he suggested that without the socialist party ever gaining a national victory most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties
mr reama who retired as vice president of the american screw co in 1955 said both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product but neither told us how to achieve it
he said he favors wage increases for workers but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices he added
indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy mr reama said a socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own
mr reama far from really being retired is engaged in industrial relations counseling
a petition bearing the signatures of more than 1700 johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town
william a martinelli chairman of the citizens group of johnston transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of council president raymond fortin sr
the law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and mr martinelli happens to hold that post
mr martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days
he explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work
a difference of opinion arose between mr martinelli and john p bourcier town solicitor over the exact manner in which the vote is handled
mr martinelli has in recent weeks been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote while mr bourcier said that a special election might be called instead
mr bourcier said that he had consulted several superior court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures
he assured mr martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible
mr martinelli said yesterday that the citizens group of johnston will meet again july 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement
he said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes
after inspiring this i think we should certainly follow through on it he declared
it has become our responsibility and i hope that the citizens group will spearhead the movement
he said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required nonpartisan ballot for posts on the charter commission
our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement he indicated and to tell them what this will mean for the town
he expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in september
some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday with spokesmen for the towns insurgent democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter
increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks it was indicated
misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the citizens group to obtain signatures under what were termed false pretenses
several signers affixed their names it was learned after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the general assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the johnston sanitary district sewer system
action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at mondays special north providence town council meeting
council president frank sanantonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request town solicitor michael a abatuno to draft the ordinance
at the last session of the general assembly the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective
nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation
at present all offenses must be taken to sixth district court for disposition
local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense
plainfield
james p mitchell and sen walter h jones rbergen last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by richard j hughes democratic gubernatorial candidate that the gop is campaigning on the carcass of eisenhower republicanism
mitchell was for using it jones against and sen wayne dumont jr rwarren did not mention it when the three republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the park hotel
the controversial remark was first made sunday by hughes at a westfield young democratic club cocktail party at the scotch plains country club
it was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in trenton monday at a forum of the state federation of womens clubs
hughes said monday it is the apparent intention of the republican party to campaign on the carcass of what they call eisenhower republicanism but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after eisenhower retired
now hes gone the republican party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state
sunday he had added we can love eisenhower the man even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the republican party without his leadership
mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign
how can a man with any degree of common decency charge this
he asked
the former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an eisenhower republican and proud to have absorbed his philosophy while working in his adminstration
mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last falls presidential election did not mean that eisenhower republicanism was a dead issue
regrets attack
jones said he regretted hughes had made a personal attack on a past president
he is wrong to inject eisenhower into this campaign he said because the primary is being waged on state issues and i will not be forced into rearguing an old national campaign
the audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of hughes remark
dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary
he then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign
state aid to schools the continuance of railroad passenger service the proper uses of surplus funds of the port of new york authority and making new jersey attractive to new industry
decries joblessness
mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the meyner administration and the republicancontrolled state senate must share the blame for this
noting that plainfield last year had lost the mack truck co plant he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform
but i am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time mitchell said
jones unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions saved his barbs for mitchell
he said mitchell is against the centralization of government in washington but looks to the kennedy administration for aid to meet new jersey school and transportation crises
he calls for help while saying he is against centralization but you cant have it both ways jones said
the state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities real estate or motor vehicles he said and i challenge mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue
defends ike
earlier mitchell said in a statement
i think that all americans will resent deeply the statements made about president eisenhower by richard j hughes
his reference to discredited carcass or tattered remains of the presidents leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the american people as president of the united states and who has been the symbol to the world of the peaceloving intentions of the free nations
i find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste
such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature
it can only rebound to mr hughes discredit
sees jones ahead
sen charles w sandman rcape may said today jones will run well ahead of his gop opponents for the gubernatorial nomination
sandman state campaign chairman for jones was addressing a meeting in the military park hotel newark of essex county leaders and campaign managers for jones
sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that jones will be chosen the republican partys nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years
sandman said the announcement that sen clifford case aj has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for mr mitchell is a dead giveaway
it is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about new jerseys problems
we have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project mr mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from washington
that failed
we are now witnessing an effort to transfer to mr mitchell some of the glow of sen cases candidacy of last year
that too will fail
sandman announced the appointment of mrs harriet copeland greenfield of 330 woodland ave westfield as state chairman of the republican women for jones committee
mrs greenfield is president of the westfield womens republican club and is a westfield county committeewoman
county supervisor weldon r sheets who is a candidate for the democratic gubernatorial nomination today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them
the proposal sheets said represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in new jersey more than a lip service word
sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10year period without interest or charge
sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by january 1964
although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines
the candidacy of mayor james j sheeran of west orange for the republican nomination for sheriff of essex county was supported today by edward w roos west orange public safety commissioner
sheeran a lawyer and former fbi man is running against the republican organizations candidate freeholder william macdonald for the vacancy left by the resignation of neil duffy now a member of the state board of tax appeals
my experience as public safety commissioner roos said has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience and preferably one who is a lawyer
jim sheeran fits that description

william j seidel state fire warden in the department of conservation and economic development has retired after 36 years of service
a citation from conservation commissioner salvatore a bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state
seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the university of michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies
in october 1944 he was appointed state warden and chief of the forest fire section
under his supervision the state firefighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting
he also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station
he introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens
he is credited with setting up an annual cooperative fire prevention program in cooperation with the red cross and state department of education

richard j hughes made his morris county debut in his bid for the democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge to carry the issues to every corner of the state
he promised nearly 200 democratic county committee members at the meeting in the puddingstone inn when i come back here after the november election youll think youre my man youre the kind of governor were glad we elected
he said we democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just and not what is expedient at the time
attacks republicans
in his only attack on the republicans hughes said the three republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary
but well have a liberal well planned forward looking honest platform
well not talk out of one side of our mouth in morris county and out of the other side in hudson
well take the truth to the people and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in november
he said you can see signs of the republicans feeble attack on the meyner administration
but i shall campaign on the meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead
he urged new jersey to become a full partner in the courageous actions of president kennedy
he called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by southern states and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry
we must keep the bloodstream of new jersey clean the former superior court judge said
to prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the republican administration in the early 1940s
calling the democrats the party that lives breathes and thinks for the good of the people hughes asked a representative democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in november
hughes supported gov meyners green acres plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development
he said legislation for a 60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced monday
conservation plan
the plan will provide 45 million for purchase of open land by the state
the other 15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis
hughes said this is not a plan to conquer space but to conserve it pointing out the state population has increased 125000 each year since 1950
he said morris county is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas there will be no land left to preserve
hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the republican candidates are involved
he said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the republicans
after the primary he promised ill be explicit on where i stand to bring you a strong dynamic administration
im not afraid to tangle with the republican nominee
trenton
fifteen members of the republican state committee who are retiring voluntarily this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues
the outgoing members whose fouryear terms will expire a week after the april 18 primary election received carved wooden elephants complete with ivory tusks to remember the state committee by
there may be other 1961 state committee retirements come april 18 but they will be leaving by choice of the republican voters
a special presentation was made to mrs geraldine thompson of red bank who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee
she also was the original gop national committeewoman from new jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the womens suffrage amendment
she served one fouryear term on the national committee
resentment welled up yesterday among democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that mayor wagner had decided to seek a third term with paul r screvane and abraham d beame as running mates
at the same time reaction among antiorganization democratic leaders and in the liberal party to the mayors reported plan was generally favorable
some antiorganization democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the democratic party that has been going on for the last three years
the resentment among democratic organization leaders to the reported wagner plan was directed particularly at the mayors efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders
some viewed this attempt as evidence that mr wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party
opposition reported
some democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce state controller arthur levitt of brooklyn to oppose mr wagner for the mayoral nomination in the sept 7 democratic primary
these contend there is a serious question as to whether mr wagner has the confidence of the democratic rank and file in the city
their view is that lastminute changes the mayor is proposing to make in the democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as mayor
in an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate mr wagner talked by telephone yesterday with representative charles a buckley the bronx democratic leader and with joseph t sharkey the brooklyn democratic leader
mayor visits buckley
as usual he made no attempt to get in touch with carmine g de sapio the manhattan leader
he is publicly on record as believing mr de sapio should be replaced for the good of the party
last night the mayor visited mr buckley at the bronx leaders home for a discussion of the situation
apparently he believes mr buckley holds the key to the democratic organizations acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle
in talks with mr buckley last week in washington the mayor apparently received the bronx leaders assent to dropping controller lawrence e gerosa who lives in the bronx from this years ticket
but mr buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick mr gerosas successor
screvane and beame hailed
the mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted mr screvane who lives in queens to replace abe stark the incumbent as the candidate for president of the city council and mr beame who lives in brooklyn to replace mr gerosa as the candidate for controller
the mayor spoke yesterday at the united irish counties feis on the hunter college campus in the bronx
after his speech reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions published in yesterdays new york times
the mayor said
it didnt come from me
but as i have said before if i announce my candidacy i will have something definite to say about running mates
boston june 16
a wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in massachusetts
there is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics
the taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are all the same
its see joe see jim he says
the hand is out
a political scientist writes of the growth of alienated voters who believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt selfish and beyond popular control
these voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy the object of which is to plunder them
corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of edwin oconnors novel the last hurrah
but there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject
a succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year
graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and federal investigations
and the election of president kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state
a reader of the boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery or worse is the norm in massachusetts public life
day after day some new episode is reported
the state public works department is accused of having spent 8555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property
an assistant attorney general is directed to investigate
washington june 18
congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers
in the senate several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition
in the house the southernrepublican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the administrations housing bill while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aidtoeducation bill
the housing bill is now in the house rules committee
it is expected to be reported out tuesday but this is a little uncertain
the panels action depends on the return of representative james w trimble democrat of arkansas who has been siding with speaker sam rayburns forces in the rules committee in moving bills to the floor
mr trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back tuesday
leadership is hopeful
the housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of southern democrats and conservative republicans
the democratic leadership however hopes to pass it sometime this week
the 6100000000 measure which was passed last monday by the senate provides for fortyyear mortgages at low downpayments for moderateincome families
it also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories
the education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the rules committee where two northern democratic members who usually vote with the administration are balking because of the religious controversy
they are james j delaney of queens and thomas p oneill jr of massachusetts
three groups to meet
what could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the national defense education act of 1958
this would provide for longterm federal loans for construction of parochial and other privateschool facilities for teaching science languages and mathematics
mr delaney and mr oneill are not willing to vote on the publicschool measure until the defense education bill clears the house education and labor committee
about half of all peace corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups according to an official of the corps
in the 40000000 budget that has been submitted for congressional approval 26000000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies
twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contractnegotiation stage gordon boyce director of relations with the voluntary agencies said in a washington interview
six of these were proposed by religious groups
they will be for teaching agriculture and community development in southeast asia africa the middle east and latin america
question raised
interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the peace corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods means and goals
there are a number of ways this could happen the churchmen pointed out and here is an example
last month in ghana an american missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled
when he protested the hotel owner said
why do you worry
the u s government is paying for it
the u s government pays for all its overseas workers
missionary explains
i dont work for the government the american said
im a missionary
the hotel owner shrugged
same thing he said
and then some churchmen remarked there is a more classical churchstate problem
can religious agencies use government funds and peace corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state
r sargent shriver jr director of the corps is certain that they can
no religious group he declared in an interview will receive peace corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes
moscow june 18
at a gay party in the kremlin for president sukarno of indonesia premier khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said beaming look he took everything i had
mr khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker
indonesia is one of the twenty underdeveloped countries of asia africa and latin america that are receiving soviet aid
the soviet union and other members of the communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations
the communist countries allocated more than 1000000000 in economic aid alone last year according to western estimates
this was the biggest annual outlay since the communist program for the underdeveloped countries made its modest beginning in 1954
in 1960 more than 6000 communist technicians were present in those countries
united nations n y june 18
a committee of experts has recommended that a countrys population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the united nations
this was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the soviet union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the united nations
one effect of the proposal which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength as in the past would be to take jobs from european nations and give more to such countries as india
india is the most populous united nations member with more than 400000000 inhabitants
the new formula for filling staff positions in the secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report
the report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the united nations
formula is due this week
the advisory committee on administrative and budgetary questions is expected to receive the report this week
the jobs formula is understood to follow these lines
each of the organizations ninetynine members would get two professional posts such as political affairs officer a department head or an economist to start
each member would get one post for each 10000000 people in its population up to 150000000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts
each member with a population above 150000000 would get one additional post for each additional 30000000 people up to an unspecified cutoff point

thousands of bleachertype seats are being erected along pennsylvania avenue between the capitol and the white house for the big inaugural parade on jan 20
assuming the weather is halfway decent that day hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as president john f kennedy and retiring president dwight d eisenhower leave capitol hill following the oathtaking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route
pennsylvania avenue named for one of the original 13 states perhaps is not the most impressive street in the district of columbia from a commercial standpoint
but from a historic viewpoint none can approach it
many buildings
within view of the avenue are some of the united states governments tremendous buildings plus shrines and monuments
of course 1600 pennsylvania the white house is the most famous address of the free world
within an easy walk from capitol hill where pennsylvania avenue comes together with constitution avenue begins a series of great federal buildings some a block long and all about sevenstories high
great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue now about 169 years old
in the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade
they were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote
in the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time
seats on square
along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the war between the states returning in 1865 is the national archives building where hundreds of thousands of this countrys most valuable records are kept
also the department of justice building is located where j edgar hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation
street car tracks run down the center of pennsylvania powered with lines that are underground
many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering lafayette square opposite the white house
in this historic square are several statues but the one that stands out over the others is that of gen andrew jackson hero of the battle of new orleans
moving past the presidential viewing stand and lafayette square will be at least 40 marching units
about 16000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade
division one of the parade will be the service academies
division two will include the representations of massachusetts and texas the respective states of the president and of vicepresident l b johnson
then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union
division three will be headed by the marines followed by 12 states
division four will be headed by the navy followed by 11 states
division five by the air force followed by 11 states

what does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in mississippi
even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the states immediate political future
this is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants gov ross barnett
barnett who came into office with no previous experience in public administration has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well
consequently it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the barnett administration will take in the coming year
could be scramble
some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far
the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of jobseekers and others who feel they were given commitments by barnett at some stage of his eightyear quest for the governors office
there are many who predict that should barnett decide to call the legislature back into special session it will really throw his administration into a scramble
certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together barnett will be able to enjoy a reenactment of the strange but successful honeymoon he had in the 1960 legislative session
if barnett doesnt call a special session in 1961 it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature has not met in regular or special session
the odds favor a special session more than likely early in the year
districts issue
legislators always get restless for a special session whether for the companionship or the 2250 per diem is not certain and if they start agitating
barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure
the issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the states congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat
with eyes focused on the third congressional district the historic delta district and congressman frank e smith as the one most likely to go the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the delta have held in the legislature
mississippis relations with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 with the first democratic president in eight years in the white house
split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents the democratic party in mississippi is currently a wreck
and there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together
future clouded
barnett as the titular head of the democratic party apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary
with a democratic administration party patronage would normally begin to flow to mississippi if it had held its democratic solidarity in the november election
now the picture is clouded and even us sens james o eastland and john c stennis who remained loyal to the ticket are uncertain of their status
reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen
baton rouge la
the gov jimmie h davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 with the governors theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses
the year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue
but it might give way shortly to another vexing issue that of finances in state government
the transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent
the administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program
but the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an overall shortage of cash than to segregation
legislators weary
indeed the administrations curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat
the administration could not say why 28 million was needed for a grantinaid program
the effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required twothirds vote
the tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when the legislature reconvenes
davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the legislature to normalcy
if it fails to pass he can throw up his hands and say the legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration
he could terminate special sessions of the legislature
actually davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway
many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the sofar losing battle to block token integration
this is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly
they would like to convey the notion something is being done even though it is something they know to be ineffectual
underlying concern
passage of the sales tax measure would also give davis the means to effect a transition
he could tell the legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle
then he could tell them to go home while the administration continued to wage the battle with the 28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period
it is difficult to be certain how the administration views that 28 million since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one
but if the administration should find it does not need the 28 million for a grantinaid program a not unlikely conclusion it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes
this would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration the shortage of cash
it could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year
if the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill or any other tax bill it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interesting dilemma
since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues
constant problem
in either case it could call a special session of the legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser
the prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor
it is one that most try to avoid as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem
but if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off it can be expected the davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state legislature
this might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the legislature so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year
a constant problem confronting davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize
any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves
the new year might see some housecleaning either genuine or token depending upon developments to give davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms
city controller alexander hemphill charged tuesday that the bids on the frankford elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had an inside track with the city
estimates of the citys loss in the 344000 job have ranged as high as 200000
shortcuts unnoticed
hemphill said that the hughes steel erection co contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the legitimate bids of competing contractors
the hughes concern then took shortcuts on the project but got paid anyway hemphill said
the controllers charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures tuesday
the city has sued for the full amount of the 172400 performance bond covering the contract
the philadelphia transportation co is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project
the signature of harold v varani former director of architecture and engineering in the department of public property appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project
varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor
managing director donald c wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter
the announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by city solicitor david berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with wagner and other officials of the city and the ptc as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the el project before its completion in 1959
concern bankrupt
the hughes company and the consolidated industries inc both of 3646 n 2d st filed for reorganization under the federal bankruptcy law
on monday the hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization
business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by hemphill and district attorney james c crumlish jr
intervenes in case
the suit was filed later in the day in common pleas court 7 against the hughes company and two bonding firms
travelers indemnity co and the continental casualty co
at bergers direction the city also intervened in the hughes bankruptcy case in u s district court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there
i am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated berger said
the contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the el track
the contract called for overhauling of 102 joints
the city paid for work on 75 of which no more than 21 were repaired hemphill charged
wide range in bids
hemphill said the hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of 500 for each joint
the bid from a belanger and sons of cambridge mass which listed the same officers as hughes was 600 per joint
but hemphill added bids from other contractors ranged from 2400 to 3100 per joint
bergers decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by wagner in the morning press conference
wagner said the city paid only 37500 to the hughes company
we wont know the full amount until we get a full report wagner said
we can claim on the maximum amount of the bond berger said
wagner replied cant you just see the headline city hooked for 172000
know enough to sue
berger insisted that we know enough to sue for the full amount
douglas m pratt president of the ptc who attended the meeting said the transit company is reviewing the work on the el
we want to find out who knew about it pratt said
certain people must have known about it
the ptc is investigating the whole matter pratt said
samuel d goodis representing the philadelphia hotel association objected on tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year
goodis voiced his objection before city councils finance committee
for hotels with 1000 rooms the increased license fee would mean an expense of 5000 a year goodis said
testifies at hearing
his testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses permits and city services
the new fees are expected to raise an additional 740000 in the remainder of 1961 and 2330000 more a year after that
the ordinance would increase the fee for rooming houses hotels and multifamily dwellings to 5 a room
the cost of a license now is 2 with an annual renewal fee of 1
goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels
revenue estimated
the city expects the higher rooming house hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional 457000 a year
the increase also was opposed by leonard kaplan spokesman for the home builders association of philadelphia on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses
a proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from councilwoman virginia knauer who formerly raised pedigreed dogs
the ordinance would increase fees from 1 for males and 2 for females to a flat 5 a dog
commissioner replies
mrs knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the citys services to animal care
in reply deputy police commissioner howard r leary said that the city spends more than 115000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only 43000 in fees
he reported that the citys contributions for animal care included 67000 to the womens spca
15000 to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and 15000 to investigate dog bites
backs higher fees
city finance director richard j mcconnell indorsed the higher fees which he said had been under study for more than a year
the city is not adequately compensated for the services covered by the fees he said
the new fee schedule also was supported by commissioner of licenses and inspections barnet lieberman and health commissioner eugene a gillis

the plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by dr constantinos a doxiadis former minister of reconstruction in greece and a consulting planner for the new eastwick corp
the plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic
it provides for a series of landscaped walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through the center of the entire twoandahalfmile length of the project

ankara turkey oct 24 ap
turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with gen cemal gursel as president
an agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on oct 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup detat
bypassing the military junta which has ruled turkey since the overthrow of premier adnan menderes 17 months ago the army general staff led by gen cedvet sunay had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government
the army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on gen gursel as president
gen gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months
the military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned
party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own

helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically e m martin assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the world affairs council monday night
martin who has been in office in washington d c for 13 months spoke at the councils annual meeting at the multnomah hotel
he told some 350 persons that the united states challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways following their own paths
we must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which if not identical is congenial with ours he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty
patience needed
insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice he said was the biggest detriment to the soviet union
he cited east germany where after 15 years of soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in and added so long as people rebel we must not give up
martin called for patience on the part of americans
the countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build he said
by leaving our doors open the united states gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare he said
individual help best
we have no reason to fear failure but we must be extraordinarily patient the assistant secretary said
economically martin said the united states could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves
private business is more effective than government aid he explained because individuals are able to work with the people themselves
the united states must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country at what he termed a social cost
martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country
the portland school board was asked monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with portlands civil defense more plans for the citys schools in event of attack
but there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go and whose advice it should follow
the board members after hearing the coordination plea from mrs ralph h molvar 1409 sw maplecrest dr said they thought they had already been cooperating
chairman c richard mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem in case of atomic attack but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go
dr melvin w barnes superintendent said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership perhaps on the national level to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would be more fruitful and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district
los angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster he said
nobody really expects to evacuate
i think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following
mrs molvar who kept reiterating her request that they please take a stand said we must have faith in somebody on the local level and it wouldnt be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children
dr barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans even for a high school where there were lots of cars might not be realistic and would not work
mrs molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with jack lowes program
the board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting
it was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done is going to be done and what it thought should be done

a stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the assemblies of god in session at the memorial coliseum
the council revised in an effort to strengthen the denominations 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966
the changes unanimously adopted were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the bible
the council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the bible
at the adoption the rev t f zimmerman general superintendent commented the assemblies of god has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has without compromise stood for the great truths of the bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives
new point added
many changes involved minor editing and clarification
however the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list
the first of 16 beliefs of the denomination now reads
the scriptures both old and new testament are verbally inspired of god and are the revelation of god to man the infallible authoritative rule of faith and conduct
the third belief in six points emphasizes the diety of the lord jesus christ and
emphasizes the virgin birth
the sinless life of christ
his miracles
his substitutionary work on the cross
his bodily resurrection from the dead
and his exaltation to the right hand of god
super again elected
friday afternoon the rev t f zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive twoyear term as general superintendent of assemblies of god
his offices are in springfield mo
election came on the nominating ballot
friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming program breakthrough scheduled to fill the churches for the next two years
in his opening address wednesday the rev mr zimmerman urged the delegates to consider a 10year expansion program with breakthrough the theme for the first two years
the rev r l brandt national secretary of the home missions department stressed the need for the first two years work
surveys show that one out of three americans has vital contact with the church
this means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life he told delegates friday
church loses pace
talking of the rapid population growth upwards of 12000 babies born daily with an immigrant entering the united states every 112 minutes he said our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge
in 35 years we have opened 7000 churches the rev mr brandt said adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10000 persons
in this light we need 1000 churches in illinois where we have 200
800 in southern new england we have 60
we need 100 in rhode island we have none he said
to step up the denominations program the rev mr brandt suggested the vision of 8000 new assemblies of god churches in the next 10 years
to accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods he said
church meets change
the churchs ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour
a capsule view of proposed plans includes
encouraging by every means all existing assemblies of god churches to start new churches
engaging mature experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population centers
surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers laymen who will be urged to move into the area of new churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project
arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 612 months as apprentices in wellestablished churches
us dist judge charles l powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys monday in portlands insurance fraud trial
denials were of motions of dismissal continuance mistrial separate trial acquittal striking of testimony and directed verdict
in denying motions for dismissal judge powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are
attorney dwight l schwab in behalf of defendant philip weinstein argued there is no evidence linking weinstein to the conspiracy but judge powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide
proof lack charged
schwab also declared there is no proof of weinsteins entering a conspiracy to use the us mails to defraud to which federal prosecutor a lawrence burbank replied
it is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the us mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy and the mails were then used to carry it out
in the afternoon defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case

siebern hits homer
over the first five frames jack fisher the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 american league pennant held the as scoreless while yielding three scattered hits
then dick hyde submarineball hurler entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3to3 deadlock
a tworun homer by norm siebern and a solo blast by bill tuttle tied the game and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the athletics their fifth victory in eight starts
house throws wild
with one down in the eighth marv throneberry drew a walk and stole second as hyde fanned tuttle
catcher frank houses throw in an effort to nab throneberry was wide and in the dirt
then heywood sullivan kansas city catcher singled up the middle and throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run
rookie southpaw george stepanovich relieved hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the as fifth tally on a walk to second baseman dick howser a wild pitch and frank ciprianis single under shortstop jerry adairs glove into center
the orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three kansas city pitchers
three were doubles brooks robinson getting a pair and marv breeding one
hartman impressive
bill kunkel bob hartman and ed keegan did the mound chores for the club down from west palm beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in miami stadium
the birds got five hits and all three of their runs off kunkel before hartman took over in the top of the fourth
hartman purchased by the as from the milwaukee braves last fall allowed no hits in his scoreless threeinning appearance and merited the triumph
keegan a 6foot3inch 158pounder gave up the orioles last two safeties over the final three frames escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the birds threatened but failed to tally
robinson doubles again
in the ninth robinson led off with his second double of the night a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left
whitey herzog performing in right as the orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring worked keegan for a base on balls
then three consecutive pinchhitters failed to produce
pete ward was sent in for house and after failing in a bunt attempt popped to howser on the grass back of short
john powell batting for adair fanned after fouling off two 2and2 pitches and buddy barker up for stepanovich bounced out sharply to jerry lumpe at second to end the 2hourand27minute contest
the orioles got a run in the first inning when breeding along with robinson the two birds who got a pair of hits doubled to right center moved to third on russ snyders single to right and crossed on kunkels wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate
the flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out
jackie brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally
lumpe errs
jim gentile bounced a hard shot off kunkels glove and beat it out for a single and when lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman throneberrys head brandt took third and gentile second on the error
then robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners
when robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple he was cut down in a close play at third tuttle to andy carey
the detailed rundown on the kansas city scoring in the sixth went like this
lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face hyde and romped around as siebern blasted hydes next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center
carey singles
carey singled on a slowbouncing ball to short which robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first
it was ruled a difficult chance and a hit
then throneberry rapped into a fast double play
breeding to adair to gentile setting up tuttles 390foot homer over the wall in left center
if the orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days it will have to be at the expense of the american league champion new york yankees who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test sunday afternoon

austin texas
a texas halfback who doesnt even know the teams plays eldon moritz ranks fourth in southwest conference scoring after three games
time stands still every time moritz a 26yearold army signal corps veteran goes into the field
although he never gets to play while the clock is running he gets a big kick several every saturday in fact out of football
moritz doesnt even have a nose guard or hip pads but hes one of the most valuable members of the longhorn team that will be heavily favored saturday over oklahoma in the cotton bowl
thats because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries
he ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last saturday night in the 418 slaughter of washington state
moritz is listed on the longhorn roster as a right halfback the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team
but ask coach darrell royal what position he plays and youll get the quick response placekicker
a 208pound 6foot 1inch senior from stamford moritz practices nothing but placekicking
last year when he worked out at halfback all season he didnt get into a single game
this year coach royal told me if id work on my placekicking he thought he could use me said moritz
so i started practicing on it in spring training
moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right kicking leg and as a result several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough
moritz said monday his leg feels fine and as a result he hopes to start practicing field goals this week
he kicked several while playing at stamford high school including one that beat anson 30 in a 1953 district game
i kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school he said and made 26 in a row at one time
i never did miss one in a playoff game i kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years
moritz came to texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury
he missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee then played 77 minutes in 1956
his statistical record that year when texas won only one game and lost nine was far from impressive he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards
he went into the army in march 1957 and returned two years later
but he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season
place kicking is largely a matter of timing moritz declared
once you get the feel of it theres not much to it
ive tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them cant seem to get the feel
practice helps you to get your timing down
its kind of like golf if you dont swing a club very often your timing gets off
moritz however kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session
if you kick too much your leg gets kinda dead he explained
footnotes
in their first three games the longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times or 40 per cent
their total passing yardage in three games 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries
tailback james saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries
he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games
saxton has made only one secondhalf appearance this season and that was in the washington state game for four plays he returned the kickoff 30 yards gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench
wingback jack collins injured a knee in the washington state game but insists hell be ready for oklahoma
last week when royal was informed that three longhorns were among the conferences top four in rushing he said that wont last long
it didnt
monday he had four longhorns in the top four
a good feeling prevailed on the smu coaching staff monday but attention quickly turned from saturdays victory to next weeks problem rice university
the mustangs dont play this week
were just real happy for the players coach bill meek said of the 97 victory over the air force academy
i think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on
it was the first time weve been ahead this season when john richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal
assistant coach john cudmore described victory as a good feeling i think on the part of the coaches and the players
we needed it and we got it
meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end happy nelson and halfback billy gannon
both turned in top jobs for the second straight game
nelson played magnificent football meek praised
he knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times
and he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown
he broke that boy air force fullback nick arshinkoff in two and knocked him loose from the football
gannon contributed saving plays on the falcons aerial thrusts in the late stages
one was on a fourthdown screen pass from the mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into gannons territory
as soon as it started to form gannon spotted it meek said
he timed it just right and broke through there before the boy halfback terry isaacson had time to turn around
he really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss
the air forces and the games final play was a long pass by quarterback bob mcnaughton which gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards
he just lay back there and waited for it meek said
he almost brought it back all the way
except for sophomore center mike kelsey and fullback mike rice meek expects the squad to be physically sound for rice
kelsey is very doubtful for the rice game meek said
hell be out of action all this week
he got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game
there is definitely some ligament damage in his knee
rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with maryland
hes looking a lot better and hes able to run meek explained
well let him do a lot of running this week but i dont know if hell be able to play
the game players saw the air force film monday ran for 30 minutes then went in while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes
well work hard tuesday wednesday and thursday meek said and probably will have a good scrimmage friday
well work out about an hour on saturday then well work monday and tuesday of next week then taper off
smu will play the owls at rice stadium in houston in a night game saturday oct 21

the dallas texans were back home monday with their third victory in four american football league starts a 1912 triumph over the denver broncos but their visit will be a short one
the texans have two more road games at buffalo and houston before they play for the home folks again and it looks as if coach hank strams men will meet the bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in preseason reckonings
buffalo coach buster ramsey who has become one of the games greatest collectors of quarterbacks apparently now has found a productive pair in two exnational football leaguers m c reynolds and warren rabb
rabb the former louisiana state field general came off the bench for his debut with the bills sunday and directed his new team to a 2212 upset victory over the houston oilers defending league champions
just our luck
exclaimed stram
buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way
ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself for the dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against denver and the texans were able to whip the dangerous broncs without the fullbacking of a top star jack spikes though he did the teams placekicking while nursing a knee injury
our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well said stram monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game
in fact our whole defensive unit did a good job
the texans won the game through ball control with quarterback cotton davidson throwing only 17 passes
we always like to keep the ball as much as we can against denver because they have such an explosive attack explained stram
they can be going along doing little damage then bang bang they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble
the broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the texans but dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off
the principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to abner haynes the flashy halfback
he was called upon 26 times more than all of the other ballcarriers combined and delivered 145 yards
the texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when denvers al carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when dave grayson the speedy halfback hit him and guard al reynolds claimed it for dallas
a quick touchdown resulted
that permitted us to start controlling the ball right away said stram quipping i think ill put that play in the book
the early southwest conference football leaders texas arkansas and texas a m made a big dent in the statistics last week
texas 545yard spree against washington state gave the longhorns a 3game total offense of 1512 yards 1065 rushing and 447 passing a new swc high
arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing on 5 completions in 7 tosses and a tough defense to whip tcu and a m with a 38point bulge against texas tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950
completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards the aggies had a total offense of 361 yards
texas leads in pergame rushing averages 355 yards and passing 149 to baylors 126 but idle baylor has the best defensive record 1875 yards per game to texas 189
a m has the best defense against passes 347 yards per game
not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use the major leagues have ordered their own tests which are in progress at massachusetts institute of technology
rookie ron nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching monday night as the bears made it two straight over indianapolis 53
the husky 63 205pound lefthander was in command all the way before an onthescene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the denver area
it was nischwitz third straight victory of the new season and ran the grizzlies winning streak to four straight
they now lead louisville by a full game on top of the american association pack
nischwitz fanned six and walked only charley hinton in the third inning
he has given only the one pass in his 27 innings an unusual characteristic for a southpaw
the bears took the lead in the first inning as they did in sundays opener and never lagged
dick mcauliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against lefty don rudolph to open the bears attack
after al paschal gruonded out jay cooke walked and jim mcdaniel singled home mcauliffe
alusik then moved cooke across with a line drive to left
jay porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but don werts smash was knocked down by rudolph for the putout
the bears added two more in the fifth when mcauliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner paschal doubled down the rightfield line and cooke singled off phil shartzers glove
nischwitz was working on a 3hitter when the indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth
chuck hinton tripled to the rightfield corner cliff cook and dan pavletich singled and gaines infield roller accounted for the tallies
the bears added their last run in the sixth on alusiks double and outfield flies by porter and wert
gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third indianapolis run in the ninth
despite the 45degree weather the game was clicked off in 148 thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play
chico ruiz made a spectacular play on alusiks grounder in the hole in the fourth and wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base
bingles and bobbles
cliff cook accounted for three of the tribes eight hits
it was the seasons first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order
the infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark
mary dobbs tuttle was back at the organ
among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer patti waggin who is mrs don rudolph when off the stage

billy gardners line double which just eluded the diving minnie minoso in left field drove in jim lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the minnesota twins a 65 victory over the chicago white sox monday
lemon was on with his fourth single of the game a liner to center
he came all the way around on gardners hit before 5777 fans
it was gardners second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year
turk lown was tagged with the loss his second against no victories while ray moore won his second game against a single loss
the twins tied the score in the sixth inning when reno bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on lenny greens double to left
the white sox had taken a 54 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits a triple by roy sievers and single by camilo carreon a walk and a sacrifice fly
jim landis 380foot home run over left in the first inning gave the sox a 10 lead but harmon killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking bob allison aboard
al smiths 340blast over left in the fourth his fourth homer of the campaign tied the score and carreons first major league home run in the fifth put the sox back in front

ogden utah may 1 ap
boston red sox outfielder jackie jensen said monday night he was through playing baseball
ive had it he told a newsman
i know when my reflexes are gone and im not going to be any 25th man on the ball club
this was the first word from jensen on his sudden walkout
jensen got only six hits in 46 atbats for a batting average in the first 12 games
he took a midnight train out of cleveland saturday without an official word to anybody and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to reno nev where his wife former olympic diving champion zoe ann olsen awaited
she said when she learned jackie was heading home im just speculating but i have to think jack feels hes hurting bostons chances
the union pacific railroad streamliner city of san francisco stopped in ogden utah for a few minutes
sports writer ensign ritchie of the ogden standard examiner went to his compartment to talk with him
the conductor said to ritchie i dont think you want to talk to him
youll probably get a ball bat on the head
hes mad at the world
but jackie had gone into the station
ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand
i told him who i was and he was quite cold
but he warmed up after a while
i told him what liston had said and he said liston was a doublecrosser and said anything he liston got was through a keyhole
he said he had never talked to liston
liston is bill liston baseball writer for the boston traveler who quoted jensen as saying
i cant hit anymore
i cant run
i cant throw
suddenly my reflexes are gone
just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging
and so it was over the weekend what with 40yearold warren spahn pitching his nohit masterpiece against the giants and the giants willie mays retaliating with a recordtying 4homer spree sunday
both of course were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime
of the two cherished achievements the elderly spahns hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts
it was a real stimulant to a lot of guys i know who have moved past the 2scoreyear milestone
and one of the milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked wish i was 40 and a topgrade big leaguer
the modest and happy spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days
but there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the alltime great lefthanders in the games history
yes with bob grove carl hubbell herb pennock art nehf vernon gomez et al
spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow a ball players ball player as they say in the trade
i remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at bears stadium oct 14 1951 before a new record crowd for the period of 18792
spahnie doesnt know how to merely go through the motions remarked enos slaughter another allout guy who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse
the spectacular mays who reaches a decade in the big leagues come may 25 joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings
incidentally only two did it before a home audience
bobby lowe of boston was the first to hit four at home and gil hodges turned the trick in brooklyns ebbetts field
ed delahanty and chuck klein of the phillies the braves joe adcock lou gehrig of the yankees pat seerey of the white sox and rocky colavito then with cleveland made their history on the road
willies big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of mays and mickey mantle
this is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion depending on whether youre an american or national fan and anti or proyankee
the record books however would favor the giants ace
in four of his nine previous seasons mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases
once the figure was 3030
willies lifetime batting average of is 11 points beyond mickeys
the giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy candlestick park suddenly found the formula in milwaukees park
it will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump
the denverarea tv audience was privileged to see mays four home runs thanks to a new arrangement made by bob howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his bears are playing at home
this rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the games top rulers
the last couple of years the bears management got the business from the living room athletic club when games were cut off
actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy
this year i am told the cbs network will continue to abide by the rule but nbc will play to a conclusion here
there are two more sunday afternoons when the situation will arise
it is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good especially at the minor league level
you would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from bears stadium last year because of the television policy
this dissatisfaction led to howsams request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game
cincinnati ohio ap
the powerful new york yankees won their 19th world series in a 5game romp over outclassed cincinnati crushing the reds in a humiliating 135 barrage monday in the loosely played finale
with mickey mantle and yogi berra both out of action due to injuries the american league champs still mounted a 15hit attack against a parade of eight cincinnati pitchers the most ever used by one team in a series game
johnny blanchard mantles replacement slammed a 2run homer as the yankees routed loser joey jay in a 5run first inning
hector lopez subbing for berra smashed a 3run homer off bill henry during another 5run explosion in the fourth
the yanks also took advantage of three cincinnati errors
the crowd of 32589 had only two chances to applaud
in the third frank robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center about 400 feet away with two men on
momentarily the reds were back in the ball game trailing only 63 but the drive fizzled when john edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out
in the fifth wally post slashed a 2run homer off bud daley but by that time the score was 115 and it really didnt matter
the yankee triumph made ralph houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a world series victory in his first year as a manager
only bucky harris the boymanager of washington in 1924 and eddie dyer of the st louis cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat
philadelphia jan 23
nick skorich the line coach for the football champion philadelphia eagles was elevated today to head coach
skorich received a threeyear contract at a salary believed to be between 20000 and 25000 a year
he succeeds buck shaw who retired at the end of last season
the appointment was announced at a news conference at which skorich said he would retain two members of shaws staff jerry williams and charlie gauer
williams is a defensive coach
gauer works with the ends
choice was expected
the selection had been expected
skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave norm van brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the minnesota vikings the newest national football league entry
van brocklin the quarterback who led the eagles to the title was signed by the vikings last wednesday
philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player
with skorich at the helm the eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running rather than passing
in the past the club depended largely on van brocklins aerials
skorich however is a strong advocate of a balanced attack split between running and passing
coach played 3 years
skorich who is 39 years old played football at cincinnati university and then had a threeyear professional career as a lineman under jock sutherland with the pittsburgh steelers
an injury forced skorich to quit after the 1948 season
he began his coaching career at pittsburgh central catholic high school in 1949
he remained there for four years before moving to rensselaer polytechnic institute in troy n y
he was there one season before rejoining the steelers as an assistant coach
four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the green bay packers
the eagles signed him for shaws staff in 1959
skorich began his new job auspiciously today
at a ceremony in the reception room of mayor richardson dilworth the eagles were honored for winning the championship
shaw and skorich headed a group of players coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football

the 53yearold shea a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a national league club to new york
named by mayor wagner three years ago to head a committee that included james a farley bernard gimbel and clint blume shea worked relentlessly
his goal was to obtain a national league team for this city
the departure of the giants and the dodgers to california left new york with only the yankees
despite countless barriers and disappointments shea moved forward
when he was unable to bring about immediate expansion he sought to convince another national league club to move here
when that failed he enlisted branch rickeys aid in the formation of a third major league the continental with new york as the key franchise
the continental league never got off the ground but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand

golfs golden boy
arnold palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months
he won the masters the united states open and a record 80738 in prize money
he was heralded as sportsman of the year by sports illustrated and last night was acclaimed in rochester as the professional athlete of the year a distinction that earned for him the 10000 diamondstudded hickok belt
but he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot
a couple of weeks ago he scored a monstrous 12 on a par5 hole
it made him human
and it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair
if such a paragon of perfection as palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege there was hope left for all
it was neither a spirit of selfsacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated arnold
he merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all
the worlds best golfer shooting below par came to the last hole of the opening round of the los angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher
he boomed a 280yard drive
then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance
no margin for error
on the narrow fairway of a 508yard hole arnold whipped into his second shot
the ball went off in a majestic arc an outofbounds slice
he tried again and once more sliced out of bounds
he hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side
it is possible that i overcorrected he said ruefully
each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes
so he wound up with a dozen
it was a nice round figure that 12 he said as he headed for the clubhouse not too much perturbed
from the standpoint of the army of duffers however this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since ben hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the texas open
the idol of the hackers of course is ray ainsley who achieved a 19 in the united states open
their secondary hero is another pro willie chisholm who drank his lunch during another open and tried to blast his way out of a rockstrewn gully
willies partner was long jim barnes who tried to keep count
stickler for rules
how many is that jim
asked willie at one stage of his excavation project
thirteen said long jim
nae man said willie ye must be countin the echoes
he had a 16
palmers dozen were honestly earned
nor were there any rules to save him
if there had been he would have found a loophole because arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book
this knowledge has come in handy too
his first shot in the open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway
the ball floated downstream
a spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie
arnold sent for joe dey the executive secretary of the golf association
joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream
i knew it all along confessed arnold with a grin but i just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there
for a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings
yet he remains the fiercest of competitors
hell even bull headon into the rules when he is sure hes right
thats how he first won the masters in 1958
it happened on the twelfth hole a 155yarder
arnolds iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains thereby bringing local rules into force
ruling from on high
i can remove the ball cant i
asked palmer of an official
no said the official
you must play it where it lies
youre wrong said arnold a man who knows the rules
ill do as you say but ill also play a provisional ball and get a ruling
he scored a 4 for the embedded ball a 3 with the provisional one
the golfing fathers ruled in his favor
so he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke
until a few weeks ago however arnold palmer was some godlike creature who had nothing in common with the duffers
but after that 12 at los angeles he became one of the boys a bigger hero than he ever had been before
a formula to supply players for the new minneapolis vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by national football league owners at a meeting at the hotel warwick today
other items on the agenda during the meetings which are expected to continue through saturday concern television rules changes professional footballs hall of fame players benefits and constitutional amendments
the owners would like each club in the fourteenteam league to play a homeandhome series with teams in its division plus two games against teams in the other division
however this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks
pete rozelle the league commissioner pointed out
well have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other
nine of the leagues teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an earlyseason conflict in dates
if the cardinals heed manager gene mauch of the phillies they wont be misled by the pirates slower start this season
pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat mauch said here the other day
the pirates showed they could outclass the field last year
they have the same men no age problem no injuries and they also have vinegar bend mizell for the full season along with bobby shantz
tonight at 8 oclock the cardinals who gave the pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 breaking even with them will get their first 1961 shot at baseballs world champions
the pirates have a 96 record this year and the redbirds are 79
change in pitchers
solly hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher from bob gibson to ernie broglio for several reasons 1 broglios 40 wonlost record and 124 earnedrun mark against pittsburgh a year ago
2 the desire to give broglio as many starts as possible
3 the redbirds disheartening 117 collapse against the phillies sunday
manager hemus eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand moved gibson to the wednesday night starting assignment
after thursdays open date solly plans to open with larry jackson against the cubs here friday night
harvey haddix set back by the flu this season will start against his former cardinal mates who might be playing without captain kenny boyer in tonights game at busch stadium
boyer is suffering from a stiff neck
haddix has a 138 record against the redbirds despite only a 13 mark in 1960
pirate manager danny murtaugh said he hadnt decided between mizell and vern law for wednesdays game
mizell has won both of his starts
nieman kept in lineup
after a lengthy workout yesterday an open date hemus said that bob nieman definitely would stay in the lineup
that means stan musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record fivehome run day against the giants
i have to stay with nieman for a while hemus said
bill white sore ankles should be ready
with a lefthander going for pittsburgh i may use don taussig in center
lindy mcdaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes and he looked good hemus said
he should be getting back in the groove before long
our pitching is much better than it has shown
the statistics hardly indicated that the pirates needed extra batting practice but murtaugh also turned his men loose at busch stadium yesterday
six bucks over
until the bucs bats quieted down a bit in cincinnati over the weekend the champions had eight men hitting over
despite the recession pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages smoky burgess gino cimoli bill virdon bob clemente and dick groat each
dick stuart don hoak
and bob skinner

bill mazeroski with and hal smith with were the only pirates dragging their feet
perhaps the pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that musial probably will sit out most of the series is bob friend who was beaten by the man twice last season on dramatic home runs
friend is off to a great start with a 40 record but isnt likely to see action here this week
were getting friend some runs for a change and he has been pitching good murtaugh said
virdon has been blasting the ball
no plunkers for him
six bucs over
the pirates jumped off to an 113 start by may 1 last year when the redbirds as well as the dodgers held them even over the season
on last may 1 the cardinals stood at 76 ending a twoseason falloff on that milestone
in 1958 the birds were 310 on may 1
a year later they were 413
since 1949 the st louis club has been below on may 1 just four times
the 49 team was off to a soso 55 beginning then fell as low as 1217 on may 23 before finishing with 96 victories
the 52 cards were 67 on may 1 but ended with 88 triumphs the clubs top since 1949
then last season the birds tumbled as low as 1118 on may 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories
since 1949 the only national league club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the 55 dodger team
those dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 212 mark and a ninegame lead by may 8
the club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was new yorks 51 giants who dropped 11 of their first 13
they honored the battling billikens last night
speakers at a tipoff club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of st louis university players who in the words of coach john benington had more confidence in themselves than i did
the most valuable player award was split three ways among glen mankowski gordon hartweger and tom kieffer
in addition a special award was given to bob bevo nordmann the 6foot10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury
you often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies but what this team had was a little different
the boys had a tremendous respect for each others ability
they knew what they could do and it was often a little more than i thought they could do
several times i found the players pepping me up where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk
wed be losing at halftime to a good team and hartweger would say dont worry coach well get em all right
the trio who shared the mostvaluable honors were introduced by bob broeg sports editor of the postdispatch
kieffer the only junior in the group was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch as well as his allround excellent play
mankowski the ballhawking defensive expert was cited for his performance against bradley in st louis us nationally televised victory
benington said ive never seen a player have a game as great as mankowski did against bradley that day
benington recalled that he once told hartweger that he doubted gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills
after the coach listed all the boys faults hartweger said coach before i leave here youll get to like me
mrs benington admired gordons spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team
as hartweger accepted his silver bowl he said i want to thank coachs wife for talking him into letting me play
bob burnes sports editor of the globedemocrat presented bob nordmann with his award
bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time
within a week after the injury suffered in st louiss victory in the final game of the kentucky tournament nordmann was sitting on the bills bench doing what he could to help benington
on the clock given him was the inscription for outstanding contribution to billiken basketball 196061
other lettermen from the team that compiled a 219 record and finished as runnerup in the national invitation tournament were art hambric donnell reid bill nordmann dave harris dave luechtefeld and george latinovich
this team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future benington pointed out
by winning against bradley kentucky and notre dame on those teams home courts they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesnt take a super team to do it
st louis university found a way to win a baseball game
larry scherer last night pitched a nohit game said to be the first in billiken baseball history as the blue and white beat southeast missouri state college 51 at crystal city
the victory was the first of the season for the billikens after nine defeats and a tie
the tie was against southeast missouri last friday
scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double len boehmer also was 4for5 with two doubles and dave ritchie had a home run and a triple
st louis u was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against washington university at ligget field
the game opened a busy week for washington
the bears are set to play at harris teachers college at 330 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at quincy ill saturday
happy hitting
if its true that contented cows give more milk why shouldnt happy ball players produce more base hits
the two top talents of the time mickey mantle and willie mays have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which to be frank about it never have quite reached expectations
and thats meant as a boost not a knock
mays and mantle both 10year men at 30 have so much ability that baseball men agree theyve never hit the heights
their heights that is
mantle the bullnecked blond switchhitter had one sensational triplecrown season 1959 when he batted and also led the american league in home runs 52 and rbis 130
like the yankees slugger mays the terror of the giants has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players but not by or for willie
his best years were 1954 when he hit with 41 homers and 55 when he belted 51 home runs drove in 127 and stole 24 bases
now apparently happier under new managers mays and mantle the perfect players are behaving as though theyre going to pass those previous peaks
labor relations
yes we know theyre professionals men paid to play and they shouldnt care how theyre handled just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month
the truth is though that men react differently to different treatment
for that matter stan musial is rare possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers reserving his opinions but not his effort
mantle its apparent resented casey stengels attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility
the old man was almost too possessive
stengel inherited dimaggio rizzuto but he brought up mantle from class c to the majors from joplin to new york
with the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him ol case wanted no 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter but also the best bunter baserunner and outfielder
stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats
inheriting a more mature mantle who now has seen the sights on and off broadway ralph houk quietly bestowed no pun intended the mantle of authority on mickey
the major decided that rather than be led the slugger could lead
and what leadership a proud mantle has given so far
the opinion continues here that with a 162game schedule pitching spread thin through a 10team league and a most inviting target in los angeles wrigley field jr mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books babe ruths 60 homers of 1927
four for alvin
mays day came a day earlier for willie than for the kids and commies this year
willies wonderful walloping sunday four home runs served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for alvin dark
next to leo durocher dark taught mays the most when he was a grassgreen rookie rushed up to the polo grounds 10 years ago this month to help the giants win a dramatic pennant

a cheery smile a compassionate interest in others and a practical downtoearth approach
those qualities make esther marr a popular asset at the salvation armys social center at 1200 larimer st
the pert grayhaired woman who came to denver three years ago from buffalo ny is a civilian with the army
her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director
the job also covers a number of other items
mom marr as the more than 80 men at the center call her is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society
her day starts early but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written and during may which is national salvation army week there are plenty schedules to be made or problems to be solved mrs marrs office is always open and the welcome mat is out
mrs marr is the first contact a skid row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up
she sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures
usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men mrs marr explained
the denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center
and i bum tickets to everything i can she said
ive become the greatest beggar in the world
in addition to the tickets to the movies sporting events and concerts mrs marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system
mrs marr also has a number of parolees to mother watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society
by midjune millions of americans will take to the road on vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely land
in another four weeks with schools closed across the nation the great allamerican summer safari will be under way
by july 1 six weeks from now motelkeepers all over the nation will by 6 pm be switching on that bleak to motorists sign no vacancy
no matter how many americans go abroad in summer probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car throw suitcases kids and comic books in the back seat and head for home
and where is home that magic place of the heart
ah that is simple
home is where a man was born reared went to school and most particularly where grandma is
that is where we turn in the good old summertime
the land lies ready for the coming onslaught
my husband and i a month ahead of the rush have just finished a 7day motor journey of 2809 miles from tucson ariz to new york city
set for influx
i can testify that motels service and comfort stations they go together like scots and heather dog wagons roadside restaurants souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting
i hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent farflung overnight accommodations
maybe motelkeeping isnt the nations biggest industry but it certainly looks that way from the highway
there are motels for all purposes and all tastes
there are even motels for local weather peculiarities in shamrock tex as i discovered
there the royal motel advertises all facilities vented heat air conditioned carpeted free tv storm cellar
many with pools
innumerable motels from tucson to new york boast swimming pools swim at your own risk is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools
some even boast two pools one for adults and one for children
but the royal motel in shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar
motorists like myself who can remember the old tourists accommodated signs on farm houses and village homes before world war 2 can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fastgrossing motel business
all for 14
at the boxwood motel in winchester va we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite an elegant affair with walltowall carpeting gold and white furniture pink satin brocade chairs 24inch tv and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels
all for 14
that made up for the best motel in norman okla where the proprietor knocked 2 off the 850 tab when we found ants in the pressedpaper furniture

the baltimore and ohio railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and layoffs effective at 1201 am next saturday
the current monthly payroll comes to about 15000000
howard e simpson the railroads president said a drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action
the reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the b o operates
salary cut and layoffs
it will be accomplished in two ways 1
a flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions
there are about 3325 officers and employees in this class
2
sufficient layoffs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense
since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough a b o spokesman said
those union members kept on their jobs therefore will not take a cut in their wages
the spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the layoffs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job

the anne arundel county school superintendent has asked that the board of education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what
the proposal was made by dr david s jenkins after he and mrs d ellwood williams jr a board member and longtime critic of the superintendent argued for about fifteen minutes at this weeks meeting
the disagreement was over what dr jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting
cites discrepancies
mrs williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of dr jenkinss conversation and how they were written up for the boards approval
i hate to have these things come up again and again dr jenkins commented as he made his suggestion
these are the boards minutes
ill write what you tell me to
for a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago
it was about that time a board member said later that dr thomas g pullen jr state superintendent of schools told dr jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him
the board of county commissioners the sanitary commission the planning and zoning board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings
dr jenkins notes however that most of the school boards in the state do not do so

barber summoned
he called vincent l piraro proprietor of the shop who summoned police and an ambulance
the vice president of the city council complained yesterday that there are deficiencies in the citys snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible
councilman william d schaefer d fifth said in a letter to mayor grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month
werner criticized
conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than baltimore after the last storm mr schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here
he said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in december
equipment should be in operation almost immediately after the first snowfall mr schaefer said
the councilman who is the administration floor leader also criticized bernard l werner public works director for halting snow operations on tuesday night after the sunday storm
sent home for rest
mr werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week
what he did mr werner said was let manual laborers go home tuesday night for some rest
work resumed wednesday he said
mr schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them should be strictly enforced
admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority the councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive
recounting personal observations of clearance work the councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes

maryland contracts for future construction during october totaled 77389000 up to 10 per cent compared to october 1960 f w dodge dodge corporation reported
dodge reported the following breakdown
nonresidential at 20447000 down 28 per cent
residential at 47101000 up 100 per cent
and heavy engineering at 9841000 down 45 per cent
the cumulative total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted to 634517000 a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding period of last year
a breakdown of the tenmonth total showed
nonresidential at 253355000 up 22 per cent
residential at 278877000 up 12 per cent
and heavy engineering at 102285000 down 33 per cent
residential building consists of houses apartments hotels dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter
the share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments which began about six years ago has more than tripled within that span of time
in 1961 it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction
while availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartmentbuilding field
although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments leo j pantas vice president of a hardware manufacturing company pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house
convenience held key
convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today
troublefree longlife quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960 pantas predicted
sixtyseven living units are being added to the 165unit harbor view apartments in the cherry hill section
ultimately the development will comprise 300 units in twostory and threestory structures
various of the apartments are of the terrace type being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct
others which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs have balconies
the structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction
heating is by individual gasfired forced warm air systems
construction in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product according to a study by johnsmanville corporation

vital secrets of britains first atomic submarine the dreadnought and by implication of the entire united states navys stillbuilding nuclear sub fleet were stolen by a londonbased soviet spy ring secret service agents testified today
the dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the united states in 1959 and was launched last year
it is a killer sub that is a hunter of enemy subs
it has a hull patterned on that of the united states navys nautilus the worlds first atomic submarine
its power unit however was derived from the reactor of the more modern american nuclear submarine skipjack
five held for trial
the announcement that the secrets of the dreadnought had been stolen was made in bow st police court here at the end of a three day hearing
a full trial was ordered for
two british civil servants miss ethel gee 46 and her newly devoted friend harry houghton 55 and divorced
they are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard
gordon a lonsdale 37 a mystery man presumed to be russian although he carries a canadian passport
when arrested he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as antisubmarine secrets in christmas gift wrapping it was testified
flashed to moscow
a shadowy couple who call themselves peter kroger bookseller and wife joyce
in washington the federal bureau of investigation identified the krogers as morris and lola cohen an american couple formerly of new york city

in their suburban cottage the crown charges the krogers received secrets from the mystery man usually on the first saturday evening of each month and spent much of the weekend getting the secrets off to moscow either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books
each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing a printed page or a manuscript
all five pleaded innocent
only miss gee asked for bail
her young british lawyer james dunlop pleaded that she was sorely needed at her portland home by her widowed mother 80 her maiden aunt also 80 and bedridden for 20 years and her uncle 76 who once ran a candy shop
refuses to grant bail
i am not prepared to grant bail to any of them said the magistrate kjp baraclough
the trial will be held probably the first week of march in the famous old bailey central criminal court where klaus fuchs the naturalized british german born scientist who succeeded in giving american and british atomic bomb secrets to russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s was sentenced to 14 years in prison
fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five who may have altered history in the 1960s
fuchs after nine and a half years was released being given time off for good behavior
he promptly went to communist east germany
the magistrate tonight refused to return to the five 29000 in american and british currency mostly 20 bills and in british government bonds and stocks
this is russian money said mervin griffithjones for the attorney generals office
he asserted that the krogers were the bankers for moscow lonsdale the red paymaster and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their countrys secrets
of highest value
the fact that secrets of the dreadnought and thereby of the american undersea fleet were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier
but just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the british navys chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare capt george symonds
he said that drawings of the dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the old vic theater saturday afternoon jan 7
the information he said would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy
court cleared
just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring watched for six months was broken remained untold
the british defending lawyers who today increased from three to four demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury the chances of their clients would improve
so in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour
almost any information about the dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the american underwater fleet
britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the american government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with britain that had been imposed after fuchs blabbed
the united states offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the skipjack
with the machinery went a complete design for the hull
the skipjack was a second generation atomic sub much advanced on the nautilus and the other four which preceded it
navys future involved
much of the navys future depends upon her an american naval announcement said on the skipjacks first arrival in british waters in august 1959 for exhibition to selected high officers at portland underwater research station
it was there that the two accused civil servants were at work
her basic hull form a teardrop and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines including the potent polaris missile submarines the statement went on
the atom reactor water cooled was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and westinghouse electric corp
thru development the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size and also in complexity allowing a single propeller to be used the navy said
the hull was also a result of almost a decade of work
it was first tried out on a conventional submarine the albacore in 1954
the skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built
reputedly it could outrun underwater the fastest destroyers
it could reputedly go 70000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month
it was of the hunterkiller type designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes
the navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in miss gees purse would if completed and handed back have given the kremlin a complete picture of our current antisubmarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future

a jury of seven men and five women found 21yearold richard pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of mrs anna hengesbach
pohl received the verdict without visible emotion
he returned to his cell in the county jail where he has been held since his arrest last july without a word to his courtappointed attorney jack walker or his guard
stepson vindicated
the verdict brought vindication to the dead womans stepson vincent hengesbach 54 who was tried for the same crime in december 1958 and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict
mrs hengesbach was killed on aug 31 1958
hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since
when the verdict came in against his young neighbor hengesbach said
i am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed
still i dont wish to appear happy at somebody elses misfortune
lives on welfare
hengesbach who has been living on welfare recently said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by his grandfather in westphalia 27 miles southwest of here
hengesbach has been living in grand ledge since his house and barn were burned down after his release in 1958
pohl confessed the arson while being questioned about several fires in the westphalia area by state police
he also admitted killing mrs hengesbach
however the confession which was the only evidence against him was retracted before the trial
charges in doubt
assistant prosecutor fred lewis who tried both the hengesbach and pohl cases said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending against pohl
circuit judge paul r cash did not set a date for sentencing
pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison or probation
walker said he was considering filing a motion for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial procedure
locked in motel
a verdict against pohl came at 405 pm after almost 1312 hours of deliberation
the jury which was locked up in a motel overnight was canvassed at the request of walker after the verdict was announced
the jury foreman mrs olive heideman of rural elsie said that a ballot was not even taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation was spent in going over the evidence
she said the jurors agreed that pohls confession was valid
the jury asked judge cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first and seconddegree murder and manslaughter
the verdict came three hours later
some 30 spectators remained in the court during the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read
the trial had packed the large courtroom for more than a week

a note making the request was handed to us ambassador winthrop g brown
heavy support
the laos government said four major pathet lao rebel attacks had been launched heavily supported by troops from communist north viet nam

emory universitys board of trustees announced friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the states tax laws made such a step possible
emory universitys charter and bylaws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race board chairman henry l bowden stated
but an official statement adopted by the 33man emory board at its annual meeting friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting negroes
the statement explained that under the georgia constitution and state law taxexempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated
emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning of true university grade and meet its financial obligations without the taxexemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions the statement said
the statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation
an emory spokesman indicated however that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws
the georgia constitution gives the legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if among other criteria all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people
at least two private colleges in the atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies but their taxexempt status never has been challenged by the state
emory is affiliated with the methodist church
some church leaders both clerical and lay have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation
urged in 1954
the student newspaper the emory wheel as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation
from its beginning the trustees statement said friday emory university has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in christian higher learning
teaching research and study according to highest standards under christian influence are paramount in the emory university policy
as a private institution supported by generous individuals emory university will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and christian education
there is not now nor has there ever been in emory universitys charter or bylaws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race color or creed
insofar as its own governing documents are concerned emory university could now consider applications from prospective students and others seeking applications from prospective students and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university irrespective of race color or creed
corporate existence
on the other hand emory university derives its corporate existence from the state of georgia
when and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory taxexemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities emory university will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the university without regard to race color or creed continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of christian higher education

the atlanta negro student movement renewed its demands for movie theater integration friday and threatened picketing and standins if negotiations failed
the demands were set forth in letters to seven owners of firstrun theaters by the committee on appeal for human rights
intend to attend
we intend to attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year the identically worded letters said
the letters set a nov 15 deadline for the start of negotiations
they indicated that standins and picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate
downtown and art theater managers and owners contacted friday night for comment on the coahr request said they had no knowledge of such a letter and that it was not in the friday mail
however three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend
gather here
the coahr letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here sunday
several theater operators said however that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the threeday affair
student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago
charles a black coahr chairman said friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on oct 31 but had failed to show up
he declined to name the three
fridays letters asked for a nov 15 meeting
failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend the letters said would be considered a sign of indifference
black said coahr hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct action but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal
a prepared statement released by the student group friday stated that extensive research by coahr into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines and standins before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits
besides managers of downtown theaters the students sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and buckhead

for a second month in a row multnomah county may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer months need the state public welfare commission was told friday
it is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in ga category for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary
william smythe director of field service told the commissioners that multnomah as of aug 22 had spent 58918 out of its budgeted 66000 in the category leaving only 7082 for the rest of the month
at the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month this could mean a shortage of as high as 17000
but it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month smythe said
no request for emergency allotment had yet been received however
board oks pact
the commission meeting for the first time with both of its newlyappointed commissioners roy webster of hood river and dr ennis keizer of north bend approved a years contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past
the contract with ray field who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape would renew his present salary of 8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month
field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes
acting administrator andrew f juras said that because of fields unique position and knowledge in the program the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period
but he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what field handles and he said he personally regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past
he pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave
salary termed modest
juras said he insisted field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government
he also said that the salary in terms of going rates in the field was modest in terms of the mans responsibility
the conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed he said and added fields long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program
do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and defend this contract
asked mrs grace o peck representative from multnomah county of the commission chairman joseph e harvey jr
my feeling at the moment he said is that we have no alternative irrespective of some of the arguments about him
the continued operation of this program depends on having his service
harvey criticized
mrs peck later joined by the commissions vicechairman mrs lee patterson took harvey to task for comments he had made to the north portland rotary club tuesday
a publicity release from oregon physicians service of which harvey is president quoted him as saying the welfare office move to salem instead of crippling the agency had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses with the key being improved communications between f a and the commission staff
i rather resent she said you speaking to those groups in portland as though just the move accomplished this
i think you fell short of the real truth in the matter that the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people
the staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles
harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare

the fbi yesterday arrested on a perjury charge one of the members of the jury that failed to reach a verdict in the freedom rider bus burning trial four weeks ago
us attorney macon weaver said the federal complaint charged that the juror gave false information when asked about ku klux klan membership during selection of jury
he identified the man as lewis martin parker 59 a farmer of hartselle ala
eight men were tried together in us district court in anniston ala on charges of interfering with interstate transportation and conspiracy growing out of a white mobs attack on a greyhound bus carrying the first of the freedom riders

one of the eight defendants was freed on a directed verdict of acquittal
a mistrial was declared in the case against the other seven when the jury was unable to agree on a verdict
the arrest of mr parker marks the third charge of wrongdoing involving the jury that heard the case
the first incident occurred before the trial got under way when judge h hobart grooms told the jury panel he had heard reports of jurytampering efforts
he asked members of the panel to tell him if anyone outside the court had spoken to them about the case
two members of the panel later told in court about receiving telephone calls at their homes from anonymous persons expressing interest in the trial
neither was seated on the jury
then when the case went to the jury the judge excused one of the jurors saying the juror had told him he had been accosted by masked men at his motel the night before the trial opened
the juror said the masked men had advised him to be lenient
the judge replaced the juror with an alternate
no formal charges have been filed as a result of either of the two reported incidents
at the opening of the trial the jury panel was questioned as a group by mr weaver about ku klux klan connections

he was not seated on the jury
the perjury charge against mr parker carries a maximum penalty of 2000 fine and five years imprisonment on conviction

vast spraying programs conducted by technicians with narrow training and little wisdom are endangering crops and wildlife carl w buchheister president of the national audubon society said today
it is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8yearold and telling him to run out and play he commented
buchheister told delegates to the west coast audubon convention that aerial spraying in louisiana failed to destroy its target the fire ant
but it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop he said
the conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in ohio and wyoming
there have even been serious errors in the u s forest service whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training he added
the news of their experiments reaches the farmers who forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries buchheister told the delegates
in addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying buchheister called for support of the wilderness bill creation of national seashore parks including point reyes
preservation of the wetlands where birds breed
a pesticides coordination act
stronger water pollution control programs and federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil
the reed rogers da fonta wild life sanctuary in marin county on friday officially became the property of the national audubon society

the presentation was made before several hundred persons at the annual meeting of the league at olney hall college of marin kentfield
buchheister pledged the land would be an inviolate sanctuary for all birds animals and plants
seventeen years ago today german scientist willy fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a v1 rocketbomb that was attached to the underbelly of a heinkel bomber
the world war 2 german bomber rolled down a runway and took off
the only way fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip
this had never been done before
now a quietspoken middleaged man fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for lockheeds missiles and space division at sunnyvale where he played a key role in the development of the navys polaris missile
he sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in 1944
the first two pilots had crashed he said
i had developed the machines and therefore knew them
it was time to go up myself
fiedler was then technical director of hitlers supersecret reichenberg project which remained unknown to the allies until after the war
about 200 of the special v1 rocketbombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead
the target was allied shipping a desperate effort to stave off the allied invasion of europe
the success of the project depended upon fiedlers flight
squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rockets automatic guidance mechanism the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude
at 12000 feet fiedler signaled release and started the roaring pulsejet engine then streaked away from beneath the heinkel
to the german pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 mph
it was probably mans first successful flight in a missile
she flew beautifully said fiedler
there was only one power control a valve to adjust the fuel flow
i had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip
using a steering system that controlled the modified rockets tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage
he managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 mph fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown and banked into the airfield
moments later the v1 skimmed across the landing strip edging closer and closer to a touchdown then in a streamer of dust it landed
fiedler went on to make several other test flights before german pilots took over the reichenberg missiles
the missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb
pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water striking below the waterline of individual ships
a crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers but the project was halted before the end of the war and the missiles later fell into allied hands
now a family man with three children fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the lockheed plant at sunnyvale
his spare time is spent in soaring gliders
its so quiet he said so slow serene and so challenging

in a letter to the american friends service dr schweitzer wrote
leading nations of the west and of the east keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out
they cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack
the only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons
otherwise no peace is possible
governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger
therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency
a federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of ben stein 47 who collected big fees as a labor consultant and operator of a janitors service

another hoodlum louis arger drew 39000 from steins janitor firm the national maintenance company in three years ending in 1959 stein disclosed in an interview
i put arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at navy pier stein said
but arger never was able to produce it so i cut him off my payroll
connection is sought
other witnesses after appearances before the jury which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect stein and his company with a number of gangsters including glimco and alex
the federal lawyers according to their witnesses also were tracing steins fees as a labor consultant
under scrutiny two of the witnesses said were payments and loans to steins national maintenance company at 543 madison st
the company supplies janitors and workmen for mccormick place and factories liquor firms and other businesses
lee a witness
among the witnesses were ed j lee director of mccormick place

lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in april with stein to supply and supervise janitors in mccormick place
steins fee lee said was 10 per cent of the janitors pay
stein estimated this amount at about 1500 or 1600 a month
a 12500 payment
leavitt as he entered the jury room said he was prepared to answer questions about the 12500 his liquor firm paid to stein for labor consultant work with five unions which organized leavitts workers
leavitt identified the unions as a warehousemans local the teamsters union a salesmans union the janitors union and a bottling workers union
government attorneys leavitt said have questioned him closely about five or six loans totaling about 40000 which the liquor company made to stein in the last year
all of the loans in amounts up to 5000 each have been repaid by stein according to leavitt
stein said he needed the money leavitt said to meet the payroll at national maintenance company
the deodorant firm run by pesce has offices in the headquarters of glimcos discredited taxi drivers union at 121315 blue island av

federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total 20000 altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately 10000
lien payments involved
huffs attorney antone f gregorio quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to huff as attorney for the loan association in satisfaction of mechanics liens on property on which the association held mortgages
huff told gregorio that he took the money to pay the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living
huff who received a salary of 109 a week from the loan association from october of 1955 until september of this year said that his private practice was not lucrative
huff lives with his wife sue and their four children 6 to 10 years old in a 25000 home with a 17000 mortgage
charge lists 3 checks

greece and west germany have ratified an agreement under which germany will pay 28700000 to greek victims of nazi persecution it was announced today
probably the hottest thing that has hit the dallas investment community in years was the morton foods stock issue which was sold to the public during the past week
for many reasons the demand to buy shares in the dallasheadquartered company was tremendous
it was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock
it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell
investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many
in fact very few customers anywhere in the nation were able to get more than 100 shares
some dallas investment firms got only 100 shares for all of their customers
a measure of how hot the stock was can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began
the stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of 1250 a share
the first overthecounter trade wednesday afternoon at eppler guerin turner the managing underwriter was at 17 a share
and from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading thursday morning at around 22 a share
but the morton foods issue was hot long before it was on the market
indeed from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in dallas last january the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up
letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold 185000 to the public at 1250 with another 5000 reserved for morton foods employes at 1150 a share
there was even a cable in french from a bank in switzerland that had somehow learned about the dallas stock offering
we subscribe 500 shares of morton foods of texas
cable confirmation it said translated
but egt could not let the swiss bank have even 10 shares
after it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone
but the result of it all was egt partner dean guerin believes an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation
i feel confident the stock will qualify for the national list he said meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country
he was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big new york investment bankers claim only they can do
but what made the morton foods stock issue such a hot one
the answer is that it was a combination of circumstances
first the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months driving stocks of all kinds up
as a result it is not easy to find a stock priced as the morton issue was priced at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64cent anticipated dividend
second the potato chip industry has caught the fancy of investors lately and until morton foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks frito and h w lay on the market
both of those have had dynamic runups in price on the market in recent months both were selling at higher priceearnings and yield bases than morton was coming to market at and everyone who knew anything about it expected the morton stock to have a fast runup
and third the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a growth industry in the public mind of late
foods which long had been considered recession resistant but hardly dynamic stocks have been acting like growth stocks going to higher priceearnings ratios
the potato chip industry these days is growing not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger
the history of the us potato chip industry is that many of todays successful companies got started during the deep depression days
those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest
but today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no secondechelon management in their firms
so they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like frito
all those things combined to make the morton foods stock the hot issue that it was and is
now if mortons newest product a corn chip known as chipos turns out to sell as well as its stock did the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to

the present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn beryl w sprinkel economist of harris trust savings bank chicago predicted at the closing session here tuesday of investment bankers assn california group conference
another speaker william h draper jr former under secretary of the army and now with the palo alto venture capital firm of draper gaither anderson urged the us to throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell moscow bluntly we wont be pushed around any more
he urged support for president kennedys requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations
not flash in pan
sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a temporary flash in the pan but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern
in view of the current expansion which promises to be substantial he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months but there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960
thesis refuted
sprinkel strongly refuted the current neostagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth declaring that this pessimism is based on very limited and questionable evidence
rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 195960 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth he said it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery
danger cited
he cautioned that the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation
the economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it even more unlikely that the federal reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958
the unsatisfactory 195860 expansion he said was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike
sacrifices needed
draper declared as i see it this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today
we must justify our heritage
we must be ready for any needed sacrifice
he said that from his experience of two years with gen clay in west berlin administration that russia respects our show of strength but that presently were not acting as we should and must
he called the cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action and noted that in war you cant buy yourself out and thats what were trying to do
while he declined to suggest how he said that sooner or later we must get rid of castro for unless we do were liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere
its the start of a direct threat to our own security and i dont believe we can permit that

stock market tuesday staged a technical recovery erasing all of mondays losses in the associated press average and making the largest gain in about two weeks
analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late monday afternoon when the list sank to a hopedfor support level represented by around 675 in the dow jones industrial average
it was a level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averages
some good news
although it looked like a routine technical snapback to wall streeters it was accompanied by some good news
a substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable goods was reported for last month
treasury secretary douglas dillon said the economy is expected to advance by a whopping 8 next year paving the way for lower taxes
the dow jones industrial average advanced 719 to 68787
of 1253 issues traded 695 advanced and 354 declined
new highs for the year totaled nine and new lows 14
trading was comparatively dull throughout the day
volume dipped to 328 million shares from 398 million monday
a 25 billion advertising budget in an 800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970s here tuesday by peter g peterson head of one of the worlds greatest camera firms in a key address before the american marketing assn
however peterson president of bell howell warned 800 us marketing leaders attending a national conference at the ambassador that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and unconventional wisdom
creations needed
as we look to the 800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40 in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed peterson said
with this kind of new product logjam the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically
the executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the shortterm advantage which it often needs
nothing to fear
peterson said america has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas
he cited as an example how the american camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of japan despite lower japanese labor costs by improving its production knowhow and technology
he also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an allautomatic camera in germany with the result that it became the best selling camera in the german market

i bought 50 shares of diversified growth stock fund on oct 23 1959 and 50 more shares of the same mutual fund on feb 8 1960
something has gone wrong some place
i am getting dividends on only 50 shares
in other words i am getting only half the dividends i should
answer
write to the funds custodian bank the first national bank of jersey city nj
that bank handles most of the paper work for diversified growth stock fund fundamental investors diversified investment fund and televisionelectronics fund
the bank installed a magnetic tape electronic data processing system to handle things
but it seems that this electronic brain wasnt programmed correctly
this resulted in a great number of errors
and letters began to come in to this column from irate shareholders
i visited the bank in march and wrote a story about the situation
at that time the people at the bank said they felt that they had the situation in hand
they indicated that no new errors were being made and that all old errors would be corrected within 60 days
that 60day period is over and letters are still coming in from shareholders of these four funds complaining about mistakes in their accounts
maybe its taking longer to get things squared away than the bankers expected
any shareholder of any of these funds who finds a mistake in his account certainly should get in touch with the bank

new york central railroad president alfred e perlman said tuesday his line would face the threat of bankruptcy if the chesapeake ohio and baltimore ohio railroads merge
perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger but could possibly be an ultimate effect
the railroad president made the statement in an interview as the interstate commerce commission opened round 2 of its hearing into the c os request to control and then merge with the b aj
all these kind of things weaken us perlman said
bad condition
board chairman howard simpson of the baltimore ohio railroad co testified the b o was in its worst financial condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation with the chesapeake ohio railroad
the financial situation of the baltimore ohio has become precarious much worse than at any time since the depression of the 1930s he told the hearing
c o president walter j tuohy was summoned back for crossexamination by new york central attorneys before examiner john bradford who is hearing the complex case
the new york central also has asked the icc to permit it to gain control of the b aj
central was rebuffed by the other two railroads in previous attempts to make it a threeway merger
the proposed c ob o railroad would make it the hemispheres second largest

consumer uncertain about economic conditions
this was the chief reason for a soso sales outlook given by twothirds of 56 builders polled by the national housing center
other reasons mentioned by onethird or more of the builders were resistance to high interest rates cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable to qualify
increase expected
the poll was taken at the centers annual builders intentions conference
it disclosed that the builders
expect their own production volume and presumably sales to jump 30 percent in 1961
look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent this year from 1960s 1257700 nonfarm housing starts
the industry has said 1960 was a poor year
starts were down 20 percent from 1959
why the discrepancy between the builders forecasts for themselves and for the industry
leaders of industry
the reason says the housing center is that the builders invited to the intentions conference are generally among the more successful businessmen and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders
elburn ill
farm machinery dealer bob houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales weve sold four corn pickers since labor day and have good prospects for 10 more
we sold only four pickers all last year
gus ehlers competitor of mr houtz in this farm community says his business since august 1 is running 50 above a year earlier
before then my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20 he says
though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas
paradoxically the sales rise is due in large measure to government efforts to slash farm output
although the administrations program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 farmers with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines
fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently
the higher price supports provided by the new legislation together with rising prices for farm products are pushing up farm income making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery
seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of august have shown gains averaging nearly 10 above last year
in august our dealers sold 13 more farm machinery than a year earlier and in september retail sales were 14 higher than last year says mark v keeler farm equipment vice president of international harvester co
for the year to date sales of the companys farm equipment dealers still lag about 5 behind 1960
two of three report gains
among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states two out of three report their sales since august 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier with the increases ranging from 5 to 50
not all sections are showing an upswing however
the droughtseared north central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend
the significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry
the demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally
farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products
more than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nations trucks buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances chemicals and other products
farmers are so eager for new machinery that theyre haggling less over prices than they did a year ago dealers report
farmers arent as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale says jack martin who sells j i case tractors and implements in sioux city iowa
this morning we allowed a farmer 600 on the old picker he traded in on a new 2700 model
last year we probably would have given him 700 for a comparable machine
mr martin sold 21 tractors in august
in august of 1960 he sold seven
dealers stocks down
with dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25 below a year ago the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the countrys farm equipment manufacturers
for example farm equipment shipments of international harvester in august climbed about 5 above a year earlier mr keeler reports
tractor production at masseyferguson ltd of toronto in july and august rose to 2418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier says john staiger vice president
with the lower dealer inventories and the steppedup demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements
merritt d hill ford motor co vice president says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers
except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961 retail farm equipment sales have trailed yearearlier levels since the latter part of 1959
the rise in sales last winter was checked when the governments new feed grain program was adopted
the program resulted in a cutback of around 20 in planted acreage and as a result reduced the immediate need for machines
nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects
total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129 of the 194749 average three points higher than the july 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960
the government also is aiding farmers income prospects
agriculture department economists estimate the government this year will hand farmers 14 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments well above the record 11 billion of 1958 and about double the 639 million of 1960
price support loans may total another 1 billion this year
with cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960 farmers gross income is estimated at 395 billion 15 billion above 1960s record high
net income may reach 127 billion up 1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953
the government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at midseptember for the third consecutive month reaching 242 of the 191014 average compared with 237 at midjuly
kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a high court depletion ruling
the supreme court decision in mid1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined
the company in figuring its taxable earnings deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products
such depletion allowances in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets
the high court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground not to the revenue from finished products
a measure passed by congress just before adjourning softened the rulings impact on prioryear returns still under review for claymining companies that make brick and tile products
the measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50 of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone
president kennedy in signing the relief measure into law stressed he regarded it as an exception
my approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries the president said
charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the irs
the service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date purpose amount and other particulars of the contribution
requests for substantiation the service indicated can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return such as tickets to a show
in such an instance revenuers stressed the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received
a rule on the federal deductibility of state taxes is contested
a realty corporation in louisiana owed no tax under federal law on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation
louisiana however collected an income tax on the profits from the sale
the corporation in filing its final federal income return claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense as permitted under us tax law
the revenue service disallowed the claim invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was taxexempt income
the tax court rejected this view
it said the taxfreedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations
the tax court decision and a similar earlier finding by the ninth circuit court of appeals challenges a yearold irs ruling on the subject
the service has not said what its next step will be
peace corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency
it provides that the 1800 termination payment each cadet is to get after serving a twoyear hitch without pay will be spread over both years not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received
the owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and kicked back to the companys advertising manager the tax court ruled
the taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager
the court upheld the taxpayers contention that these kickbacks were not his income though they passed through his hands
the court limited its decision to the tax issue involved commenting it is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction
a portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel
the revenue service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the federal manufacturers excise tax on householdtype appliances
hiring the wife for ones company may win her taxaided retirement income
a spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls for example may be entitled to distributions under the companys pension plan as well as to her own social security coverage
she would be taxed on the pensions when received of course but the companys contributions would be taxfree
a frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement experts warn is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income
in that event they note the revenue service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law
possible upshots the company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made

consumer spending edged down in april after rising for two consecutive months the government reported
the commerce department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under 18 billion in april down 1 from the march level of more than 182 billion
april sales also were 5 below those of april last year when volume reached a record for any month 189 billion see chart on page one
the seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as easter was on april 2 this year two weeks earlier than in 1960 and preeaster buying was pushed into march
commerce department officials were inclined to explain the april sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in march
adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 25 from those of the month before which in turn were slightly higher than the january low of 178 billion

back in college todays handsome gander was the only male member of a texas tech class on food
the pretty coeds must have ogled him all day long but he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy
last october he gave a public speech in washington dc entitled are women here to stay
so you can see that gerald g ramsey director of smus food services is not the ordinary type of craven womentrodden chef
he is apt to rear back and claim his rights
ramsey as smus food wrangler buys enough groceries to serve 32000 meals a week
tell that to the little wife when she moans at the womans burden
he also dishes up 3000 snacks
and he operates three cafeterias in the student center along with mcelvaney dining hall and the athletes tables
ramsey 63 195 and ruggedly slim says i cant remember when i didnt pester my mother to teach me to cook
he was in charge of the hockaday school meals from 1946 to 1950 before he moved to aj
and youll notice that in both places there are acres of charming young ladies who with little effort spice up any chow line
what does he feed his smu football mastodons at the training table
mostly meat and potatoes they have to have that gogogo without getting too fat says ramsey
so he hides the mayonnaise
and to keep athletes stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress he bans all highly flavored condiments
what do the pretty smu girls like on their plates
pretty much hamburger hotdogs steak and at night maybe pizza says the handsome food expert
unfortunately there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower
ramsey has stoked up harry truman henry cabot lodge the king of morocco clement atlee and other shiny characters
once four tibetan monks in their saffron robes filed through the cafeteria line
they arent supposed to look at women you know ramsey recalled
what with all those pretty girls around they had a hard time

add enough warmed cream seasoned to taste with onion juice to about half cover the chicken breasts
bake slowly at least onehalf hour longer
while this is baking saute mushrooms fresh or canned in butter
sprinkle over top of chicken breasts
serve each breast on a thin slice of slowbaked ham and sprinkle with thompson seedless grapes
leave off the ham and you call it chicken pontiac says ramsey

contemporary furniture that is neither danish nor straightline modern but has sculptured pattern many design facets warmth dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability
that is the goal of two new collections being introduced in dallas this month
though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the 20s and 40s two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated but warm look in contemporary
these two heritage and drexel chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece but a collection of correlated designs each of which could stand alone
the heritage collection to be shown by sangerharris and andersons studio has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time
called perennian to indicate its lasting good today and tomorrow quality the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces
walnut wormy chestnut pecan three varieties of burl handwoven philippine cane ceramic tiles marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors brick or paneled walls windows that bring in the outdoors
it is a collection with a customdesign look offering simplicity with warmth variety and vitality
the drexel collection called composite to be shown by titches offers a realistic approach to decorating a mature modern that is a variation of many designs
rounded posts give a soft sculptured look paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches table tops are inlaid in macassar ebony or acacia
a highlegged buffet provides easytoreach serving a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end recessed arched panels decorate a 60inch long chest
an interesting approach to the bedroom is presented with a young basic functional group of chests dressers and corner units and a canted headboard
the other bedroom has heavier styling doorfronted dressers with acacia panels a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror
colorful bright eastman chromspun fabrics with the magenta pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with composite
the fabrics have scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles
design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote drexels fall 1961 group composite
the spiderleg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top
seethrough design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an oriental shoji flavor
to bring warmth to the dining area golden orange tones are used in the fabrics
dignity and comfort in a contemporary manner reflecting the best aspects of todays design with substance and maturity keynote the perennian collection from heritage
center panel handscreened wood actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases
mellow bronzygreengold fabrics and the gleam of copper and handcrafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the alexander smith carpet in all wool loop pile

theres a lot of talk about the problem of education in america today
what most people dont seem to realize if they arent tied up with the thing as i am is that 90 of the problem is transportation
i never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until at long last both of my boys got squeezed into high school
it seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to fingerpaint at the grammar school
getting to and from school was no problem
they either walked or were driven
now they go to a high school that is two miles away
one might think the problem would be similar
they could walk ride on a bus or be driven
its much more complex than that
generally they go to school with a girl named gloriana who lives down the block and has a car
this is a way of getting to school but i understand it entails a certain loss of social status
a young man doesnt like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isnt even in a higher class than he is and is also a girl
why dont you walk to school then
i suggested
my father walked through two miles of snow in illinois
did you
i was asked
no i said i didnt happen to grow up in illinois
i explained however that i had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom
i had to ride a streetcar two miles
sometimes the streetcar was late
sometimes there werent even any seats
i had to stand up with the ladies
sometimes i got on the wrong car and didnt get to school at all but wound up at the ocean or some other dismal place and had to spend the day there
ive tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then
when they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car
she has to have at least one car herself
i feel a certain loss of status when i am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife who is only a woman
even that isnt satisfactory
if they have to take any car theyd rather take the big one
they say that when they take a car gloriana doesnt take her car but rides with them
but when gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her so the little car isnt big enough
the logic of that is impeccable of course except that i feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car by my wife when everybody knows i have a big car and am capable of driving myself
the solution naturally is the bus
however its a halfmile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus and its too hard on my legs
my wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there
but thats hardly realistic
nobody walks anymore but crackpots and harry truman and hes already got an education

heres an idea for a childs room that is easy to execute and is completely charming using puppets for lamp bases
most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action rather than put away in boxes
displayed as lamps the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent
to create such a lamp order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop
measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket allowing three to four inches above the puppets head
make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted l the foot of the l about three inches long so that the puppet can hang directly under the light
pulling strings
using the strings that manipulate the puppet suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base
in this way you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position with feet or one foot barely resting on the pedestal
if the puppets are of uniform size you can change them in accord with your childs whims
although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a childs playtime
those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merrygoround
the scalloped edge is particularly appealing
todays trend toward furniture designs from americas past is teaching homeowners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our colonial era
a generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions
in the background lurked the feeling however that these pieces beautiful as they were lacked the utilitarian touch
so juniors bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the hard knocks while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only
this isnt true of the many homemakers of the 1960s according to decorator consultant leland alden
housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs says mr alden and they are doing it largely because colonial craftsmen had an innate sense of the practical
solid investment
there are a number of reasons why the eighteenth century designer had to develop down to earth designs or go out of business
hotel escapes bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction the versatile kings 4 plus two
this is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while a well integrated fast moving outfit specializing in skits vocals comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch
show spotlights the kings george worth bill kay frank ciciulla and gene wilson flanked by dave grossman and ron stevens
the plus two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine and the beat is solid
in the comedy division the kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props
net result is some crazywonderful nonsense part of which can be classed as pure slapstick
kings 4 have rated as a popular act in vegas and western nightclubs
if they cant chalk up big business here then lets stop this noise about how hip we are and stick to our community singing

its a solid show but except for some interim keyboarding by ernie its als all the way

is there anything a frustrated individual can do about communisms growing threat on our doorstep and around the world
more than 300 teenagers last sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for jim kern and his wife lynn from 4 to 8 pm sunday at first presbyterian church
at that time the second half of the christian youth crusade against communism will be staged
a young real estate salesman kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by communism when in the navy air force
he was particularly struck by a course on communist brainwashing
kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of communism but never felt there was anything he as an individual could do about it
when he attended the christian anticommunist crusade school here about six months ago jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it
the best approach he figured was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at first presbyterian church
and he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote a biblically strong christianity
so the christian youth crusade against communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the fourhour program
this sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by kern on the world situation
a review of the philosophy of communist leaders by ted slack another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the university of miami
and talks on how their christian faith can guide them in learning about and fighting communism during high school and college days by ted place director of greater miami youth for christ and jon braun director of campus crusade for christ
the second half of the film communism on the map and the movie operation abolition also will be shown
response to the program has been so encouraging kern said that a citywide youth school at dade county auditorium may be set up soon
and to encourage other churches to try their own programs kern said this sundays sessions including the free dinner will be open to anyone who makes reservations
the need for and the way to achieve a christian home will be stressed in special services marking national christian family week in miami area churches next week
of particular meaning to the charles macwhorter family 3181 sw 24th ter will be the family dedication service planned for 1050 am sunday at first christian church
it will be the second time the assistant manager of a coral gables restaurant and his wife have taken part in the twiceayear ceremonies for families with new babies
the first one two years ago changed the routine of their home life
when you stand up in public and take vows to strive to set an example before your children and to teach them the fundamentals of the christian faith you strive a little harder to uphold those vows explains the slender vice president of the young couples sunday school class
until that first dedication service he and lois felt their children were too young to take part in any religious life at home
they have five daughters coral lee 5 glenda rae 4 pamela 3 karen 2 and shari five months
but after that service they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table have bedtime prayers and bible stories
to their surprise the children all were eager and quite able to take part
even the twoyearold feels miffed if the family has a prayertime without her

the leningrad kirov ballet which opened a series of performances friday night at the opera house is i think the finest classical ballet company i have ever seen and the production of the petipatschaikowsky sleeping beauty with which it began the series is incomparably the finest i have ever had the pleasure of witnessing
this work is no favorite of mine
i am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of imperial russia in its most vulgar infantile and reactionary aspect
that its persistent use by ballet companies of the soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was
that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the american people
that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of selfplagiarisms
all of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the kirovs utterly captivating presentation
precise
the reasons for this enchantment are numerous but most of them end in ova eva or aya
in other words no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet
it seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests miss omsk miss pinsk miss stalingr oops skip it
these qualities alone however would not account for their success and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this companys collective personality
it is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the american ballet
ohthepainofit that convention of russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished grand dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety is totally absent from the kirov
this is all the more remarkable because the kirov is to ballet what senator goldwater is to american politics
but obviously at least some things have changed for the better in russia so far as the ballet is concerned
irina kolpakova the princess aurora of fridays performance would be a change for the better anywhere at any time no matter who had had the role before
she is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on and her dancing has a feminine suavity lightness sparkle and refinement which are simply incomparable
hit
alla sizova who seems to have made a special hit in the east was delightful as the lady bluebird and her partner yuri soloviev was wonderfully virile acrobatic and poetic all at the same time in a tradition not unlike that of nijinsky
vladilen semenov a fine danseur noble
konstantin shatilov a great character dancer
and inna zubkovskaya an excellent lilac fairy were other outstanding members of the cast but every member of the cast was magnificent
the production designed by simon virsaladze was completely traditional but traditional in the right way
it was done with great taste was big and spacious sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes but sumptuous in a muted pastellike style with rich quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery
evegeni dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra one containing excellent soloists the violin solos by the concertmaster guy lumia were especially fine but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity
mail orders are now being received for the series of concerts to be given this season under the auspices of the san francisco chamber music society

san francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their annual voluntary task of fixing up toys for distribution to needy children

for a good many seasons ive been looking at the naughty stuff on television so the other night i thought i ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies
after all this years movies are next years television shows
so i went to see la dolce vita
it has been billed as a towering monument to immorality
all the sins of ancient rome are said to be collected into this threehour film
if thats all the romans did its a surprise to me that rome fell
after television la dolce vita seems as harmless as a gray line tour of north beach at night
i cannot imagine a single scene that isnt done in a far naughtier manner on tv every week
i believe tv watchers will be bored
la dolce vita has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average tv western
week in week out there is more sex to be seen in the adventures of ozzie and harriet
there is more decadence on 77 sunset strip
there are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any privateeye series
in another respect television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns
with the exception of lex barker and anita ekberg the credits are as unfamiliar as youll find on the robert herridge theater
most of the emphasis has been placed on a wild party at a seaside villa
producer fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties
the dolce vita gettogether boasted a strip tease carried as far as a black slip
a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face
a frigid beauty and three silly fairies
put them all together and they spell out the only fourletter word i can think of dull
apparently fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall
what a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining
as a moral shocker it is a dud
but this doesnt detract from its merit as an interesting if not great film
the chronicles paine knickerbocker summed it up neatly
this is a long picture and a controversial one but basically it is a moral enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps rome has from her traditional political cultural and religious glories
and when they sell it to television in a couple of years it can be shown without editing

and you think you have language problems
the week went along briskly enough
i bought a new little foreign bomb
it is a british bomb
very austere yet racy
it is very chic to drive foreign cars
with a foreign car you must wear a cap it has a leather band in the back
you must also wear a car coat
the wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive
but we couldnt really get along without it
where do you put the lighter fluid ha ha
asked the gas station man
the present crop of small cars is enriching american humor
gas station people are very debonair about small cars
when i drove a car with tail fins i had plenty status at the windandwater oases
my car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth
this excellent foreign bomb takes only six
when i had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome the gas people were happy to see me
tires ok
check the oil and water sir

they polished the windshield
they had a loving touch
the man stuck the nozzle in the gas tank
what kind of car is it
he asked gloomily
it is a british austin the smallest they make
get much mileage
about 35
the gas station man sighed unhappily
what i always say is what if somebody clobbers you in a little car like that
crunch thats all she wrote
i will die rich
that will be 180 said the gas station man
the windshield looks pretty clean
ah the fairweather friends of yesteryear
when i wheeled about finned fore and aft i was the darling of the doormen
dollar bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps politely
with a small bomb i tuck it between cadillacs
the last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself
high blood pressure can get the best of any of us

at last the white house is going to get some muchcopied furniture by that master american craftsman duncan phyfe whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the u s presidents of the 19th century sent abroad for their furnishings
the american institute of decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the executive mansions library
the suite has been in the same family since the early 1800s
the gift is being presented by heirs and descendants of the rutherford family of new jersey whose famous estate tranquility was located near the duncan phyfe workshop at andover n j
authenticated pieces of duncan phyfe furniture are uncommon although millions of american homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago
this acquisition is a matched perfect set consisting of two sofas six feet long plus six sidechairs and two armchairs
the aid has undertaken the redecoration of the white house library as a project in connection with the work being done by first lady jacqueline kennedys fine arts advisory committee to secure antiques for the presidential home
it is the aids intention to create in the library a miniature museum of americana before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall
the room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the duncan phyfe furniture
the aid has found a mantlepiece attributed to samuel mcintyre of salem mass an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the capitol here in 1792
the mantel was found in a recently demolished salem house and is being fitted over the white house library fireplace
it will be painted to match the paneling in the room
the aid committees chairman in charge of the redecoration mrs henry francis lenygon was in town yesterday to consult with white house staff members on the project
mrs lenygons committee associates announced formally yesterday by the aid in new york include mrs allen lehman mccluskey and stephen j jussel both wellknown manhattan decorators
regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include frank e barnes of boston
president kennedy couldnt stay away from his desk for the 75minute young peoples concert played on the white house lawn yesterday by the 85piece transylvania symphony orchestra from brevard n c

at 4 pm the president left the white house to welcome the young musicians students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the brevard music center summer camp and to greet the 325 crippled cardiac and blind children from the district area who were special guests at the concert
it was the first in the series of concerts for young people by young people to be sponsored by first lady jacqueline kennedy at the white house
she was not present yesterday however to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience
she is vacationing at the kennedy summer home in hyannis port mass and in his welcoming remarks the president said he was representing her
as he approached the open bandstand erected facing the south entrance to the executive mansion the band struck up the star spangled banner and followed it with hail to the chief
i think they played hail to the chief better than the marine corps band and we are grateful to them president kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor james christian pfohl
after paying tribute to the conductor and his whiteclad youthful students president kennedy said as an american i have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the united states schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music
he added i think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field
displaying his knowledge of music the new englandborn president remarked that probably the best chamber music in the world is played in vermont by young americans and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers and their work is being duplicated all across the united states
this is a great national cultural asset and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me representing as i do today my wife to welcome all of you here today at the white house
as he left the bandstand to return to his office the slender suntanned chief executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests
he expressed surprise to learn that pretty blonde patricia holbrook 16 of mount rainier had attended the joseph p kennedy school for the handicapped in boston
the nuns there do a wonderful work the president commented
patricia now attends the c melvin sharpe health school in the district
each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red white and blue ribbon
they enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the white house staff
many of the musicloving members of the presidents staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience
and it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected
henry hall wilson a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the presidents staff as liaison representative with the house of representatives turned guest conductor for a sousa march the stars and stripes forever
transylvania symphony conductor pfohl said yesterday that mrs kennedys social secretary letitia baldrige told about plans for white house youth concerts before the national symphony orchestra league in philadelphia last spring
he said he contacted a friend henry hall wilson on the presidents staff and asked whether his orchestra could play in the series
a flow of correspondence between pfohl and miss baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85student north carolina group to play the first concert
one of the most interested students on the tour which the brevard group took at the national gallery yesterday following their concert at the white house was letitia baldrige social secretary to first lady jacqueline kennedy
i was an art major in college miss baldrige explained
ive been here so many times i couldnt count them
she turned out to be a fan too of margaret bouton the gallerys associate curator of education
miss bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the gallery had closed at 5 pm
the brevard group of 85 arrived at the gallery at 6 pm remaining for about 45 minutes
the brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later
they decided that they thought rembrandts selfportrait made him look sad
they noticed roman buildings in the background of raphaels alba madonna and texture in a monet painting of rheims cathedral
everybody had heard of van gogh the french impressionist
gallery director john walker greeted the group standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them
he pointed out to the young musicians that the national gallery is the only museum in the country to have a fulltime music director richard bales
im sure youve heard of him and his record the confederacy
along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group went one of the gallerys blueuniformed guards
in 45 minutes the gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the renaissance to the late 19th century
a few of them said they preferred contemporary art
among the other artists whose paintings were discussed were boucher courbet fra angelico
the thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the gallerys rotunda fountain because its on the second floor
that imposing somewhat austere and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th st nw took on bustling life yesterday
more than 250 scottish rite masons and guests gathered in their house of the temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader albert pike who headed the scottish rite from 1859 to 1891
they came together in the huge highceilinged council chamber to hear the late leader eulogized
c wheeler barnes of denver head of the scottish rite in colorado praised pike as a historian author poet journalist lawyer jurist soldier and musician who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the masonic order
the ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of pike in the house of the temple
a reception and tea followed
about 1500 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the ancient and accepted scottish rite for the southern jurisdiction of the united states
the opening session of the 5day session will begin at 10 am today
there will be a pilgrimage to mount vernon at 230 pm
a wreath will be placed at the tomb of george washington one of this nations first masons a past master of washingtonalexandria lodge 22 in alexandria
the marriage of john and mary black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years
john had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous
he would come home in the evening tired and discouraged in no frame of mind to play with their three children or spend much time chatting with his wife
hurt by his lack of interest and attention mary complained often that he didnt help around the house and that he didnt really care about the family
she accused him of ignoring her
he in turn told her she demanded too much
they were both discouraged disgusted and miserable
mary decided she had had enough
without any definite plan in mind she went to a judge to see what could be done
the judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from family service before going to a lawyer
family service sharing in ugf has five agencies in the washington area
they offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems
because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up mr and mrs black agreed to a series of interviews at family service of northern virginia the agency nearest them
for nearly a year they have been receiving counseling separately and together in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce
the interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other
they are now working together toward solving their difficulties
john received a promotion in his firm
he gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on life
mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings and the childrens bedtime is frequently preceeded by a session of happy family roughhousing
to outsiders the blacks seem to be an ordinary happy family and they are but with a difference
they know the value of being just that an ordinary happy family
family service has helped hundreds of families in this area
perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital
but to the families it serves their help cannot be measured
family service could not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the united givers fund
anticipated heavy traffic along the skyline drive failed to materialize yesterday park rangers said and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze
for crucial encounter
one of the initial questions put to president kennedy at his first news conference last january was about his attitude toward a meeting with premier khrushchev
mr kennedy replied
im hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground
the president knew that a confrontation with mr khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable
but he was convinced that the realities of power military economic and ideological were the decisive factors in the struggle with the communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting
he wanted to buy time to strengthen the u s and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy
last friday the white house announced
president kennedy will meet with soviet premier nikita s khrushchev in vienna june 3 and 4
the announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in eastwest relations
the heightened tension in fact had been a major factor in the presidents change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the soviet leader
he was not going to vienna to negotiate the simultaneous announcements in washington and moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned
but mr kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with mr khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe
that objective set the high stakes and drama of the vienna meeting
despite efforts by washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war
road to vienna
the u s and soviet heads of government have met three times since sir winston churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace at the summit of the nations
the first time was in 1955 when a fulldress big four summit meeting produced the spirit of geneva
the spirit served chiefly to lull the west while moscow made inroads into the middle east
in 1959 president eisenhower and premier khrushchev held an informal session in the u s
that meeting produced the spirit of camp david a spirit it later turned out that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a berlin settlement
on the third occasion another big four summit session at paris a year ago there was no problem of an illusory spirit
premier khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the u s for the u2 incident
the episode tended to confirm the u s belief that propaganda the hope of onesided concessions and the chance to split the allies rather than genuine negotiation were the soviet leaders real aims in summitry
preinaugural position
thus when premier khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new president mr kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem
shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the soviet leader in these words
as long as mr khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way no amount of either smiles or toughness neither camp david talks nor kitchen debates can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations
the president had set for himself the task which he believed vital of awakening the u s and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance
he did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary
he wanted time too to review the united states global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating
above all he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to premier khrushchevs doorstep
attitude flexible
at the same time the president took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the soviet leader
ideally he knew it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels
but mr kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it
it would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war to try to probe mr khrushchevs intentions and to make clear his own views
moreover an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the u s was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions
both elements the caution about a meeting the willingness eventually to hold one were reflected in a letter from the president which ambassador llewellyn e thompson brought back to russia late in february
the letter dated feb 22 was delivered to premier khrushchev in novosibirsk siberia on march 9
it dealt mainly with a broad range of eastwest issues
but it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with mr khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted
developments over the next two months however caused the president to reconsider the question of the timing
there were intense discussions in the inner councils of the white house about the advisability of an early meeting not because the international climate was improving but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly
deadlock on tests
the president was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at geneva
the deadlock has been caused by the russians new demand for a threeman east west and neutral directorate and thus a veto over the control machinery
in the u s strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the russians may be secretly testing
mr kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown or even continued stalemate would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament
there was reason to believe that premier khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons particularly to communist china
the question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the soviet leader had not become urgent
moreover moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies including the u n secretariat and the international control commission for laos
mr kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements or even negotiations impossible
developments in cuba and laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting
initially the white house reaction was that the bitter exchanges with moscow over cuba and the conflict in laos had dampened prospects for a meeting
at the same time there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the soviet leader as a result of those episodes come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the wests ability and determination to resist communist pressure
in cuba the u s had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against communist penetration even on its own doorstep
in laos the picture was almost equally bad
u s willingness to accept a neutral laos may have led premier khrushchev to believe that other areas could be neutralized on soviet terms
beyond that allied disagreement about military intervention in laos despite warnings that they might do so allowed moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the procommunist forces
as a result the west is in a poor bargaining position at the current geneva negotiations on laos and south vietnam and other nations in southeast asia are under increased pressure
in the light of those events there appeared to be a real danger that premier khrushchev might overreach himself
ambassador thompson reported from moscow that the soviet leaders mood was cocky and aggressive
he has indicated that he plans new moves on berlin before the year is out
the president and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as berlin iran or latin america from which there would be no turning back
it was in the midst of such white house deliberations that premier khrushchev on may 4 made new inquiries through the u s embassy in moscow about a meeting with the president in the near future
mr kennedy told moscow he would give his answer by may 20 after consultation with the allies
the response from london paris and bonn was favorable
firm arrangements for the meeting in vienna were worked out in a final exchange between moscow and washington last week
apparently at the insistence of the u s the simultaneous announcements issued in washington and moscow last friday emphasized the informal nature of the meeting
the washington announcement said
the president and chairman khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries
the meeting will however afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries
the outlook
the vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned 67yearold veteran of the cold war who in mr kennedys own words is shrewd tough vigorous wellinformed and confident and a 44yearold president his birthday is may 29 with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy
the announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the u s of both approval and disapproval
the approval did not arise from an expectation of farreaching agreements at vienna
the inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations
but those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary
mr khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men
the feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the president and that plain talk by mr kennedy would give him pause
apart from the personal equation another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the us appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit
premier khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway
this time the initiative came in part at least from washington
other allies consulted
there was also the fact that by the time he meets mr khrushchev the president will have completed conversations with all the other principal allied leaders
thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity
finally there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the presidents making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord
there is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world
if tests are to be resumed the argument went it is vital that the u s make plain that the onus belongs to the soviet union
disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse
after cuba and laos it was argued mr khrushchev will interpret the presidents consent to the meeting as further evidence of western weakness perhaps even panic and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds
moreover the president is meeting the soviet leader at a time when the administration has still not decided on the scope of americas firm foreign policy commitments
the question was raised for example as to what attitude the president would take if mr khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from southeast asia to the middle east
there are so my biologist friends tell me mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory
mollusks are a case in point
the shell which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme tended to cancel out the possibility of future development
though this may or may not be good biology it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of american catholic higher education
there can be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive our european brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities
the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that
by way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence
there is however one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture
viewing the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university
but the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official american catholic project
certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy
official encouragement is one thing but the downtoearth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds
american catholics have responded generously to bishops and pastors appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning
they have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made
diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility
all of this may be understandable enough it is however in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise
yet for better or for worse the truth of the matter is that most american catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general catholic support but rather to the initiative resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities
community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible
to understand the past history and the future potential of american catholic higher education it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community
it is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment
a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere
the fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the wellsprings of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension
the net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship
american catholic colleges and universities are in a very real sense the product of private enterprise the private enterprise of religious communities
had it not been for such private enterprise diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees
there is however no point in speculating about such a possibility the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the family business
this familycommunity spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement
it is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of american catholic higher education in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas
i think for example of three womens colleges with pitifully small enrollments clustered within a few miles of a major catholic university which is also coeducational
this is not an isolated example
this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough
it would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot
apart however from the question of wasteful duplication there is another aspect of the family business spirit in american catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny
for while the past needs of the church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools it would seem that todays need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its pursuit of excellence
at the earlier preacademic excellence stage of catholic education the operation could be conducted on an intramural community basis
but with todays demand for professional qualifications and specialized training the need for outsiders becomes more pressing
the problem is not merely that more outside teachers are needed but that a different brand is called for
commenting on the earlier stage the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decisionmaking noted that the term teacheremployee as opposed to eg maintenance employee was a not inapt description
today however the outsider is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university
and while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement
in the above mentioned report of the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professors the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it even with the best of intentions he the president of the university is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which considered as it must be by him in individual terms is inhomogeneous mortal and of extremely varying temperament interests and capabilities
it is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are in their opinion identified with its highest good and to use that oftrepeated phrase the attainment of excellence
the pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to notre dame it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by the organization which actually owns it becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished outside faculty
it is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to the organization which actually owns the university this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clericallay tension
but in any case one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one
outside faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business
there are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university
in the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel
word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession much given to attending meetings and conferences
expressions of even lowkey dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype
in the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere
to appreciate the nature of the gamble it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the civil service
much has been made of the fact that major catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure
this is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated
when a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services
a man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the family
just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major catholic institutions
adequate compensation is indispensable
yet adequate compensation and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place
broadly speaking the total catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university
religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the laymans reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification
there is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that at the college level the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels
the college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication even informal debates over the luncheon table are a contribution to the total good of the institution
but this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation
the second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the ingroup that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees is therefore the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself
this is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure
yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order
the first is a negative warning there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with highsounding titles but no real authority
in the case of academic personnel the feeling of participation can hardly be faked
competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to preset conclusions without destroying the students illusion that they are making their own decisions
those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by busywork and ersatz decision making
in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all
in the notre dame report reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to luncheontable communication
in itself there is nothing wrong with this form of participation the only difficulty on the catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy ie members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution have their own eating arrangements
sen john l mcclellan of arkansas and rep david martin of nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the antimonopoly laws
once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the antimonopoly laws there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions the law must treat everybody equally
or in the words of anatole france the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich as well as the poor from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges
the public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of mr mcclellans hearings into corruption in labormanagement relations and later into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites
the senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program
in addition disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the american taxpayer who was footing the bill
it is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages but he pays the employers strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike
business week aug 9 1961 reports that the united aircraft company against which the international association of machinists had undertaken a strike decided to keep its plants operating
the company incurred some 10 million of expenses attributable to four factors advertising to attract new employees hiring and training them extra overtime and defective work performed by the new workers
the company has billed the united states government for 7500000 of these expenses under the defense department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractors business
rep frank kowalski of connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the armed services committee
the committee remains unresponsive
neither has congressman martin nor senator mcclellan been heard from on the matter
they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the antimonopoly laws to the unions
the recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the antitrust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained
the antitrust laws inform a business that it must compete but along completely undefined lines
it must play a game in which there never is a winner
the fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law
hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy
let us look at the heavyelectricalgoods industry in which general electric westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market
the industry is so structured that pricesetting by a multiproduct company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated whether marginal or average pricing is applied
the problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment
accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price
naturally enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time
should these giants really flex their competitive muscles they would become the only survivors in the industry
uncle sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by unfair competition
but if they show selfrestraint they dont get the orders
under the circumstances the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted
engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants
the paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government after the conviction that general electric sign a wideopen consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows
in other words the antitrust laws designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday wednesday and friday become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on tuesday thursday and saturday
and which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on sunday
the question might be asked dont the managements of the heavyelectricalgoods manufacturers know these facts
why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter expressing their complete confidence in the laws
the past usefulness of the antitrust laws to management was explained by thurman arnold in the folklore of capitalism back in 1937
he wrote p 211 the antitrust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure
p 214 antitrust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship
p 215 when corporate abuses were attacked it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control
in this manner every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the antitrust laws
pp 228229 in any event it is obvious that the antitrust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known held together by some of the most fantastic ideas all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government
this escape from control has led to managements evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while
a plea of nolo contendere followed by a nominal fine after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license
the penalties handed out in the electrical case which included jail sentences were unprecedented in antitrust prosecutions perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities

if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest
a secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle
however one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the antitrust laws are effective and rational
quite clearly the antitrust laws are neither effective nor rational and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union
those who favor placing trade unions under antitrust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform
before 1933 individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain english
the acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 implicit in the writing of section 7a of the national industrial recovery act has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle
the wagner act the tafthartley act and the landrumgriffin act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining
the basic purpose of an effective collectivebargaining system is the removal of wages from competition
if a union cannot perform this function then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud
the tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession
the problem must be faced squarely
if laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn unsupported by the way by any agricultural subsidy then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them
human labor was exactly that a commodity in eighteenth and nineteenthcentury america
as early as 1776 adam smith wrote in the wealth of nations we have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work
but many against combining to raise it
eighteenthcentury england upon whose customs our common law was built had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies
in 1825 the boston house carpenters strike for a tenhour day was denounced by the organized employers who declared it is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies
there were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining but against labor monopoly
the courts shared the opinion of the employers
in people vs fisher justice savage of the new york supreme court declared
without any officious and improper interference on the subject the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it
but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means
compare this statement of a nineteenthcentury judge with how congressman martin according to the daily labor report of sept 19 1961 defends the necessity of enacting antitrust legislation in the field of labor if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages hours and conditions of employment
senator mcclellan is proposing the application of antitrust measures to unions in transportation
his bill allegedly aimed at hoffa would amend the sherman clayton and norrislaguardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union even a sister local in the same international
paradoxically the same week in which senator mcclellan was attempting to extend the antitrust act to labor in transportation the civil aeronautics board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel the action would not be deemed a violation of the antitrust act
indeed it is in the field of transportation that congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the antitrust laws
for example the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers
at the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of antitrust legislation a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the antimonopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates
the passage of the sherman act was aimed at giant monopolies
it was most effective against trade unions
in the famous danbury hatters case a suit was brought against the union by the loewe company for monopolistic practices eg trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer
the suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment
in 1914 the clayton act attempted to take labor out from under the antitrust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity
the law could not suspend economics
labor remained a commodity but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the antitrust laws
the courts by interpretation emasculated the act
in 1922 the united mine workers struck the coronado coal company
the company sued under the antitrust laws alleging that the unions activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce
what other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise
the court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce
the nation
the threefront war
at a closeddoor session on capitol hill last week secretary of state christian herter made his final report to the senate foreign relations committee on us affairs abroad
afterward tennessees democratic senator albert gore summed it up for newsmen
what herter presented said gore was not a very encouraging review
that was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the west and communism erupted on three fronts
while communists were undermining united nations efforts to rescue the congo from chaos two other communist offensives stirred the eisenhower administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions
1 cuba
hours after a parade of his new soviet tanks and artillery dictator fidel castro suddenly confronted the us with a blunt and drastic demand within 48 hours the us had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in cuba to a total of eleven persons the embassy staff alone totaled 87 us citizens plus 120 cuban employees
president eisenhower held an 830 am meeting with top military and foreignpolicy advisers decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately
there is a limit to what the united states in selfrespect can endure said the president
that limit has now been reached
through secretary herter ike offered presidentelect kennedy an opportunity to associate his new administration with the breakoff decision
kennedy through secretarydesignate of state dean rusk declined
he thus kept his hands free for any action after jan 20 although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the us and latin america see the hemisphere
2 laos
after a white house huddle between the president and top lieutenants the defense department reacted sharply to a cry from the prowestern government of laos that several battalions of communist troops had invaded laos from north viet nam
in view of the present situation in laos said the pentagons announcement we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the pacific
cutting short a holiday at hong kong the aircraft carriers lexington and bennington steamed off into the south china sea accompanied by a swarm of destroyers plus troopships loaded with marines
on the uss island base of okinawa task force 116 made up of army navy marine and air force units got braced to move southward on signal
but by weeks end the laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration see foreign news and the us was agreeing with its cautious british and french allies that a neutralist rather than a prowestern government might be best for laos
french indians
there was a moral of sorts in the laotian situation that said much about all other coldwar fronts
political economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic mountainous little laos was the last place in the world to fight a war and they were probably right
it would be like fighting the french and indian war all over again said one military man
but why was laos the new southeast asian battleground
at geneva in 1954 to get the war in indochina settled the british and french gave in to russian and communist chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a communist state north viet nam which then predictably became a base for communist operations against neighboring south viet nam and laos
the late secretary of state john foster dulles considered the 1954 geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the west
he began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of aj
the important thing from now on he said is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern viet nam from leading to the extension of communism throughout southeast asia
russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of havana russian intrigue in the congo and russian arms drops in laos using the same ilyushin transports that were used to carry communist agents to the congo made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time
soviet premier khrushchev sent new years hopes for peace to presidentelect kennedy and got a cool acknowledgment in reply
considering the state of the whole world the cold wars three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous
but in senator gores words it was not a very encouraging situation that would confront john f kennedy on inauguration day
the congress
turmoil in the house
as the 87th congress began its sessions last week liberal democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the house rules committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor
the liberal pressure bloc which coyly masquerades under the name democratic study group had fought the committee before and had always lost
this time they were much better prepared and organized and the political climate was favorable
they had the unspoken support of presidentelect kennedy whose own legislative program was menaced by the rules committee bottleneck
and counting noses they seemed to have the votes to work their will
deadly deadlock
there were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the rules committee 1 to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservativeliberal deadlock or 2 to remove one of the conservatives namely mississippis 14term william meyers colmer pronounced calmer
caucusing the liberals decided to go after colmer which actually was the more drastic course since seniority in the house is next to godliness
a dour gangling man with a choppy gait colmer looks younger than his 70 years has gradually swung from a moderate internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative
he is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project unless it happens to benefit his gulf coast constituents
he is of course a segregationist but he says he has never made an antinegro speech
for 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the rules committee
there his vote along with those of chairman howard smith the courtly virginia judge and the four republican members could and often did produce a 66 deadlock that blocked farout democraticsponsored welfare legislation a tactic often acceptable to the rayburnjohnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes
equal treatment
there was sufficient pretext to demand colmers ouster he had given his lukewarm support to the antikennedy electors in mississippi
reprisals are not unheard of in such situations but the recent tendency has been for the congress to forgive its prodigal sons
in 1949 the dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against harry truman and in 1957 after congressman adam clayton powell campaigned for dwight eisenhower in 1956 his fellow democrats did not touch his committee assignments although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage
in the heat of the anticolmer drive last week judge smith threatened reprisal against powell
said he we will see whether whites and negroes are treated the same around here
but speaker sam rayburn after huddling in palm beach with presidentelect kennedy decided that this year something had to be done about the rules committee and that he was the only man who could do anything effective
in a tense closeddoor session with judge smith rayburn attempted to work out a compromise to add three new members to the rules committee two democrats including one southerner and one republican
smith flatly rejected the offer and mister sam thereupon decided to join the rebels
the next morning he summoned a group of top democrats to his private office and broke the news he would lead the fight to oust colmer whom he is said to regard as an inferior man
news of rayburns commitment soon leaked out
when missouris clarence cannon got the word he turned purple
unconscionable
he shouted and rushed off to the speakers room to object a dangerous precedent
cannon a powerful conservative man brought welcome support to the smithcolmer forces as chairman of the appropriations committee he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal porkbarrel projects
sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another judge smith ally georgias carl vinson chairman of the armed services committee
threat of war
as the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses it became clear that judge smith could lose
his highest count of supporters numbered 72 and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260member democratic caucus
the liberals smelling blood were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes in the democratic committee on committees in the full party caucus and on the floor of the house before they could oust colmer
one big question if colmer was to be purged what should the house do about the other three senior mississippians who supported the maverick electors
in all three arenas they seemed certain of victory especially with sam rayburn applying his whiplash
but in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war
if the southerners were sufficiently aroused they could very well cut the kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships leaving sam rayburn leading a truncated unworkable party
with that possibility in mind arkansas wilbur mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the committee on committees and coolheaded democrats sought to bring rayburn and smith together again to work out some sort of facesaving compromise
here are two old men mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone said a house democratic leader
one wants a little more power and the other doesnt want to give up any
battle in the senate
the senate launched the 87th congress with its own version of an ancient liberalconservative battle but in contrast with the houses guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a capitol guides speech
question at issue how big a vote should be necessary to restrict senate debate and thereby cut off legislationdelaying filibusters
a wideranging bipartisan force from minnesotas democratic hubert humphrey to massachusetts republican leverett saltonstall was drawn up against a solid phalanx of southern democrats who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills
new mexicos clint anderson offered a resolution to change the senates notorious rule 22 to allow threefifths of the senators present and voting to cut off debate instead of the current hardtoget twothirds
fair dealer humphrey upped the ante asked cloture power for a mere majority of senators
georgias dick russell objected politely and the battle was joined
privately the liberals admitted that the humphrey amendment had no chance of passage
privately they also admitted that their hopes for clint andersons threefifths modification depended on none other than republican richard nixon
in 1957 nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new congress and that any rules laid down by previous congresses were not binding
armed with the nixon opinion the senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week
hopefully the perennial battle of rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all
republicans
last act
since election day vice president richard nixon had virtually retired by his own wish from public view
but with the convening of the new congress he was the public man again presiding over the senate until john kennedys inauguration
one day last week nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of congress to hear the official tally of the electoral college vote and then to make sufficient declaration of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election
nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace then went beyond the required sufficient declaration
this is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated he said
the masters golf tournament proved last monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves
gary player the small trim south african was the eventual winner but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap
arnold palmer the defending champion lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief
just when you think you have it licked this golf course can get up and bite you player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament
and that is just what happened on the last few holes
the augusta national golf club course got up and bit both player and palmer
player was the first to feel its teeth
after playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 two strokes under par on this fifth and final day of the tournament sundays fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed players game rapidly fell to pieces
he bogeyed the 10th
after a journey through woods and stream he doublebogeyed the 13th
he bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2overpar 74 and a 72hole total of 280
as he signed his scorecard and walked off the course player was almost in tears
he could read on the nearby scoreboard that palmer by then playing the 15th hole was leading him by a stroke
palmer had started the round four strokes behind player and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes
now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf
when palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole he seemed to have the championship won
but the seveniron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression
in trying to hit it out with a sand wedge palmer bounced the ball over the green past spectators and down the slope toward a tv tower
afterwards palmer told charlie coe his lastround partner that he simply played the hole too fast
he did seem hasty on his second and third shots but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while coe graciously putted out giving palmer a chance to recover his composure which he had quite visibly lost
when the shaken palmer finally did hit his fourth shot he overshot the hole by 15 feet
palmer was now putting merely for a tie and player who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in tournament chairman clifford roberts clubhouse apartment stared in amazement when palmer missed the putt
palmers 281 for the four rounds at augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro but it was barely good enough for a secondplace tie with coe
the lean and leathery oklahoma amateur who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years refused to let the masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69
end at seven
until late last saturday afternoon palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the masters four last year and three this without ever being out of first place
as evening approached and palmer finished his saturday round with a disappointing oneoverpar 73 this remarkable record was still intact thanks to his thursday and friday rounds of 68 and 69
his threeround total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score a 213 by bill collins the tall and deliberate baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long
but palmer knew as did everybody else at augusta that his streak was about to be broken
half an hour after he finished his round player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a threeround total of 206 four strokes ahead of palmer
more than a streak had ended
long after the erratic climate and the washedout final round on sunday have become meteorological footnotes the 1961 masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between arnold palmer and gary player
unlike most such sports rivalries it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously although this was not exactly the case
when the winter tour began at los angeles last january there was no one in sight to challenge palmers towering prestige
as if to confirm his stature he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments
player won only one
but as the tour reached pensacola a month ago player was leading palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere
on the final round at pensacola the luck of the draw paired palmer and player in the same threesome and although it was far from obvious at the time the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come
on that final sunday at pensacola neither palmer nor player was leading the tournament and as it turned out neither won it
but whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour
player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of palmer
he outplayed palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to palmers 71
thereafter until the masters player gradually increased his lead over palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at miami
when they reached augusta last week together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date
instant rivalry
on thursday the first day of the masters the contest between palmer and player developed instantly
it was a dismal drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the augusta national course
the usually skiddy greens were moist and soft so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flagstick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences
palmers 4underpar 68 got him off to an early lead which he shared with bob rosburg
but player was only one stroke back with a 69
even so it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever that this tournament was to be essentially a match between palmer and player
a lot of people were still thinking about jack nicklaus the spectacular young amateur who had a 70
or ken venturi who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better
or rosburg whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of augustas treacheries
or even old byron nelson whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf
on thursday nobody except charlie coe was thinking of charlie coe

on friday a day as cloudless and lovely as thursday had been gray and ugly the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus
rosburg had started early in the day and by the time palmer and player were on the course separated as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend by about half an hour they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that rosburg who ended with a 73 was not having a good day
as player began his second round in a twosome with amateur bill hyndman his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender
player began with a birdie on the first hole added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th
on the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament
he birdied the 13th the 15th and the 18th five birdies one bogey and 12 pars for a 68
starting half an hour behind player in company with british open champion kel nagle palmer birdied the 2nd the 9th the 13th and the 16th four birdies one bogey and 13 pars for a 69
the roar of palmers gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of augusta only to be answered moments later by the roar of players gallery for a similar triumph
at one point late in the day when palmer was lining up a 25foot putt on the 16th a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that player had birdied the final hole
without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed although he later admitted that he had palmer proceeded to sink his 25footer and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply
the boldness of champions
anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course
it is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence
the bad luck that can so often mar a wellplayed round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions
bob jones played that way
byron nelson did hogan did
and last week at the masters palmer and player did
as the third round of the tournament began on saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest it was players superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead
this day palmer had started first
as player stepped on the first tee he knew that palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day
player immediately proceeded to follow suit
in fact he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well to go 4 under par for the first eight holes
but players real test came on the ninth hole a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards
he hit a poor tee shot pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways
having hit one of the trees the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out
player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 or gambling
the latter involved hitting a full fourwood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green
i was hitting the ball well player said later and i felt strong
when youre playing like that youd better attack
player attacked with his fourwood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget
it struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge
from there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4
palmer meanwhile had been having his troubles
they started on the 4th hole a 220yard par3
on this day the wind had switched 180degrees from the northwest to the southeast and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days
at the 4th tee palmer chose to hit a oneiron when a threewood was the proper club so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green
his bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par
starting the second nine palmer was already four strokes behind player and knew it
when mickey charles mantle the new york yankees man of muscle drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers his feat touches upon the sublime
when roger eugene maris mantles muscular teammate powers four home runs in a doubleheader his performance merits awe
but when tiny 145pound albert gregory pearson of the los angeles angels who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because as a teammate explained the other team thought no one was out there hits seven home runs in four months three more than his total in 1958 1959 and 1960 his achievement borders on the ridiculous
this is baseball 1961
this is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous
it is the year when 1 amiable jim gentile of the baltimore orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and in unprecedented style delivered consecutive grandslam home runs
2 willie mays of the san francisco giants borrowed a teammates bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game
3 the milwaukee braves tied a majorleague record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them
and 4 catcher johnny blanchard of the new york yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat two of them as a pinchhitter
pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats the shrinking strike zone and the fact that the knockdown pitch is now illegal
experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the american league caused by expansion
whatever the reasons not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records homerun division
of all the records in peril one stands apart dramatic in its making dramatic in its endurance and now doubly dramatic in its jeopardy
this of course is baseballs most remarkable mark the 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure the incredible athlete george herman babe ruth of the yankees
since 1927 fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at babe ruths record and each in turn has been thwarted
what ultimately frustrated every challenger was ruths amazing september surge
in the final month of the 1927 season he hit seventeen home runs a closing spurt never matched
double threat
always in the abortive attacks upon ruths record one man alone a jimmy foxx 58 in 1932 or a hank greenberg 58 in 1938 or a hack wilson 56 in 1930 made the bid
but now for the first time since lou gehrig with 47 home runs spurred ruth on in 1927 two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60
their names are mantle and maris their team is the yankees and their threat is real
after 108 games in 1927 ruth had 35 home runs
after 108 games in 1961 mickey mantle has 43 roger maris 41
extend mantles and mariss present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games and mathematically each will hit more than 60 home runs
this is the great edge the two yankees have going for them
to better ruths mark neither needs a spectacular september flourish
all mantle needs is eight more home runs in august and ten in september and he will establish a new record
in ruths day and until this year the schedule was 154 games
baseball commissioner ford frick has ruled that ruths record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games

even on the basis of 154 games this is the ideal situation insists hank greenberg now vicepresident of the chicago white sox
it has to be easier with two of them
how can you walk maris to get to mantle
roommates
neither mantle nor maris understandably will predict 60 home runs for himself
although both concede they would like to hit 60 they stick primarily to the baseball players standard quote the important thing is to win the pennant
but one thing is for certain there is no dissension between mantle the american leagues most valuable player in 1956 and 1957 and maris the mvp in 1960
each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs i hope roger hits 80 mantle says and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs and i hope i hit 81
the sluggers get along so well in fact that with their families at home for the summer mantles in dallas mariss in kansas city they are rooming together
mantle maris and bob cerv a utility outfielder share an apartment in jamaica long island not far from new york international airport
the three pay 251 a month for four rooms kitchen dining room living room and bedroom with airconditioning and new modern furniture
mantle and cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom
maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room
they divide up the household chores cerv does most of the cooking breakfast and sandwich snacks with dinner out mantle supplies the transportation a white 1961 oldsmobile convertible and maris drives the 25minute course from the apartment house to yankee stadium
mantle maris and cerv probably share one majorleague record already among them they have fifteen children eight for cerv four for mantle and three for maris
as roommates teammates and homerun mates mantle 29 who broke in with the yankees ten years ago and maris 26 who came to the yankees from kansas city two years ago have strikingly similar backgrounds
both were scholastic stars in football basketball and baseball mantle in commerce okla maris in fargo nd
as halfbacks both came close to playing football at the university of oklahoma sometimes in the minors maris recalls i wished i had gone to oklahoma
to an extent the two even look alike
both have blue eyes and short blond hair
both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds but mantle incredibly muscular he has a 1712inch neck looks bigger
with their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders both must have their clothes made to order
maris purchases 100 suits from simpsons in new york
mantle more concerned with dress buys his suits four at a time at neimanmarcus in dallas and pays as much as 250 each
light reading
neither mantle nor maris need fear being classified an intellectual but lately mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus henry millers tropic of cancer
mantle so appreciated millers delicate literary style that he broadened teammates minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips
mantle is not normally given to public speaking or for that matter to private speaking
what do you and mickey talk about at home
a reporter asked maris recently
to tell you the truth maris said mickey dont talk much
this is no surprising trait for a ballplayer
what is surprising and pleasant is that mantle and maris under constant pressure from writers and photographers are trying to be cooperative
of the two mantle is by nature the less outgoing maris the more outspoken
but last week when a reporter was standing near mantles locker mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote
see that kid
he said pointing to a darkhaired 11yearold boy
thats yogi berras
ill never forget one time i struck out three times dropped a fly ball and we lost the game
i came back sitting by my locker feeling real low and the kid walks over to me looks up and says you stunk
maris in talking to reporters tries to answer all questions candidly and fully but on rare occasions he shuns newsmen
when ive made a dumb play he says i dont want to talk to anyone
im angry
by his own confession maris is an angry young man
benched at tulsa in 1955 he told manager dutch meyer i cant play for you
send me where i can play
meyer sent him to reading pa
benched at indianapolis in 1956 he told manager kerby farrell im not learning anything on the bench
play me
farrell did and maris led the team to victory in the little world series
thats the way i am he says
i tell people what i think
if youre a good ballplayer youve got to get mad
give me a team of nine angry men and ill give you a team of nine gentlemen and well beat you nine out of ten times
idols idols
one good indication of the two mens personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes
mariss was ted williams
when i was a kid maris told a sportswriter last week i used to follow williams every day in the box score just to see whether he got a hit or not
when you came up to the majors did you seek out williams for advice
are you kidding
said maris
youre afraid to talk to a guy you idolize
mantles hero was joe dimaggio
when mickey went to the yankees says mark freeman an exyankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in denver dimaggio still was playing and every day mickey would go by his locker just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man this hero of his
but dimaggio never said a word
it crushed mickey
he told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star this never would be said of him
mantle has kept the vow
among all the yankees he is the veteran most friendly to rookies
neither mantle nor maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else
if laying ties on a railroad track which he once did for 1 an hour paid more than playing right field for the yankees maris would lay ties on a railroad track
if working in a zinc mine which he once did for 8712 cents an hour paid more than playing center field for the yankees mantle would work in a zinc mine
but since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts mantle and maris concentrate on baseball
they try to play baseball the best they can
each is a complete ballplayer
mantle beyond any question can do more things well
one of the reasons they get along fine says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men is that both realize mantle is headandshoulders above maris
hitting mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both lefthanded and righthanded maris only lefthanded
they both possess near classic stances dug in firmly arms high set for fierce swings
mantle is considerably better hitting for average
fourth in the league to
for maris so far this year
both are good bunters maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues
mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base

with this ultimate weapon the two yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season
american league expansion created inevitably weaker teams
only two teams in each league the yankees and detroit the dodgers and cincinnati are battling for first place
appropriately the emphasis on the home run at a peak this year came into being at baseballs lowest moment
in 1920 as the startling news that the 1919 white sox had conspired to lose the world series leaked out fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball
something was needed to revive interest
the something was the home run

the biggest single act would doubtless be staged by frankie himself his inaugural wardrobe had been designed by hollywood couturier don loper who regularly makes up ladies ensembles
soon after loper leaked the news that frankie had ordered two of everything just in case he spills anything frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of loper clothing

g david thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in europes best hotels but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of pittsburgh
there the name vaguely connotes newrich wealth a reputation for eccentricity and an ardor for collecting art
last week in the german city of dusseldorf g david thompson was making headlines that could well give pittsburgh pause
on display were 343 firstclass paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection and every single one of them was up for sale
like philadelphias late dr albert c barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public time jan 2 thompson at 61 is something of a legend in his own lifetime
he made his fortune during world war 2 when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom
even before he hit big money he had begun buying modern paintings
he gave the impression of never having read a word about art but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best
he was able to smell a bargain and a masterpiece a continent away and the museum of modern arts alfred barr said of him i have never mentioned a new artist that thompson didnt know about
he might barge into a gallery start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting
he could be lavishly generous with friends cab drivers and bellboys but with dealers he was tough
he bought up cezannes braques matisses legers a splendid picasso series more than 70 giacometti sculptures
he gathered one of the biggest collections of paul klees in the world
all these he hung in his burglarproof home called stones throw outside pittsburgh and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them
two years ago thompson offered his collection to the city
but he insisted that it be housed in a special museum
pittsburgh turned him down just as pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years
he went then to a 40yearold basel art dealer named ernst beyeler with whom he had long been trading pictures
last year beyeler arranged to sell 1500000 worth of klees to the state of north rhinewestphalia which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built
last week most of the other prizes once offered to pittsburgh went on the block
at the opening of the dusseldorf show thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time
in fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them
some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town
thompson himself said i want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures
break in georgia
the university of georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color
but in all its 175 years not a single negro student has entered its classrooms
last week federal district judge william a bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a qualified negro boy and girl
their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education from kindergarten through graduate school in georgia and in alabama mississippi and south carolina as well
for 18 months hamilton holmes 19 and charlayne hunter 18 had tried to get into the university
they graduated together from atlantas turner high school where valedictorian holmes was first in the class and charlayne third
the university rejected them on a variety of pretexts but was careful never to mention the color of their skins
holmes went to atlantas morehouse negro college where he is a b student and star halfback
charlayne studied journalism at detroits wayne state university
last fall after they took their hopes for entering georgia to court judge bootle ordered them to apply again
charlayne was tentatively admitted for next fall after state investigators questioned her white roommate at wayne state
but holmes was rejected again on the basis of his record and interview
the evidence in court was testimony about the interview which for holmes lasted an hour although at least one white student at georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation
holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution or a beatnik parlor or teahouse
no said he but officials still called him evasive
they also said he lied in saying that he had never been arrested
their reason holmes once paid a 20 speeding fine had his license suspended
negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students found that many were hardly interviewed at all and few had academic records as good as hamilton holmes
the real reason for his rejection they argued is the fact that georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school
judge bootles decision the two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color
the state will appeal but few think it will actually try to close the university
surprised and pleased students holmes and hunter may enter the university of georgia this week
catch for chicago
when the university of chicagos chancellor lawrence a kimpton submitted his resignation last march a mighty talent hunt gripped the midway
out went letters to 60000 old grads asking for suggestions
such academic statesmen as james b conant were consulted
two committees pondered 375 possible kimpton successors including adlai stevenson richard nixon and harvards dean mcgeorge bundy
the debate led to a decision that chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator but rather as trustee chairman glen a lloyd put it a top scholar in his own right a bright light to lure other top scholars to chicago
last week chicago happily found its top scholar in caltechs acting dean of the faculty dynamic geneticist george wells beadle 57 who shared the 1958 nobel prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry time cover july 14 1958
it fell to chancellor kimpton now a standard oil indiana executive to spend his nineyear reign tidying up chicago after the 21year typhoon of idealist robert maynard hutchins
he threw out some of hutchins more wildly experimental courses raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2100 nearly doubled endowment to 1393 million
but though kimpton put chicago in what he felt was working order some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady hutchins era
at caltech geneticist beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the schools famous biology division since 1946
but he has shown a sixthsense ability to spot recruit and excite able researchers and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speechmaking
beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters
he avidly reads the wall street journal and took delight in driving a 250 model a ford for 22 years then selling it for 300
a philosopher may point out that the troubles of the congo began with the old adam and consequently will never end
but a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away
the man was king leopold 2 of the belgians who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good
by force he took under his protection or stole 900000 square miles of wilderness in central africa
this is an area nearly as large as western europe
and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity
its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings
they were determined by the points at which leopolds explorers and gunmen got tired of walking
the population of the congo is 135 million divided into at least seven major culture clusters and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects
the religions of the people include christianity mohammedanism paganism ancestor worship and animism
the climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate
the hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars
to make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case
it has been made far more difficult by what the belgians have done or failed to do in the congo since 1885
at first the belgian royal family administered the congo as its own private property
but by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience
the belgian government itself took over administration commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism
one definition of paternalism is the principle or practice on the part of a government of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children
the honor of the belgians in this matter is not to be questioned only their judgment
ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time but when the colony received independence in 1960 the congolese child if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant
the belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the congo which is rich in copper tin cobalt manganese zinc and uranium and cotton and palm oil
the colony was administered from brussels with neither the congolese nor the resident belgians having any vote
the beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the belgian government itself held stock
in inside africa john gunther describes one of these the societe generale as the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if let us say the house of morgan anaconda copper the mutual life insurance company of new york the pennsylvania railroad and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together with the united states government as a heavy partner
had they been truly ruthless the belgians might have exploited the congolese without compassion
but they were not
they provided a social security system which covered all their african employes
their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent
they put much effort into public housing
they also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food
but instead of delivering the ration either in actual commodities or in cash at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month the belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often
would not the children if they received all their food on the first day of the month eat it up immediately and later go hungry
the belgians also placed great emphasis on education
during the 1950s there were as many as 25000 schools in the congo
but almost all the schools were primary
the average congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of la chatte and le chien and write his name
some schools were technical the belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land and trained many
but they did not believe in widespread secondary education much less in college
it was their conviction that the people should be brought up together a grade at a time until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history economics and political science
indeed the belgians discouraged higher education fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest
when the congo received its independence in 1960 there were among its 135 million people exactly 14 university graduates
why did the belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it
in one large oversimplification it might be said that the belgians felt far too late the gale of nationalism sweeping africa
they lacked time to prepare the congo as the british and french had prepared their colonies
the congolese were clamoring for their independence even though most were unsure what it meant
and in brussels street crowds shouted pas une goutte de sang
not one drop of blood

the belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue
rather than teach where teaching was not wanted they would wash their hands of the mess
it is hard to blame them for this
yet there were other motivations and actions which the belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless
as the time for independence approached there were in the congo no fewer than 120 political parties or approximately eight for each university graduate
there were four principal ones
first there were those congolese among them joseph kasavubu who favored splitting the country into small independent states balkanizing it
second there were those moise tshombe who favored nearbalkanization a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority with much power residing in the states
third there were those notably patrice lumumba who favored a unified congo with a very strong central government
and fourth there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the congo grew up
however the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting
a final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the congo immediately after independence was the provincial structure that had been established by the belgians for convenience in administration
they had divided the congo into six provinces leopoldville kasai kivu katanga equator and eastern unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings
thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other and to them independence meant an opportunity for war
the belgian congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable westernstyle form of government there were to be a president and a premier and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces
wellwishers around the world hoped that the congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations
if internal frictions arose they could be handled by the 25000man congolese army the force publique which had been trained and was still officered by white belgians
the president joseph kasavubu seemed an able administrator and the premier patrice lumumba a reasonable man
twentyfour hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other
presently the wellarmed members of the force publique many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes erupted in mutiny rioting raping and looting
terror engulfed the thousands of belgian civilians who had remained in the country
the belgian government decided to act and on july 10 dispatched paratroops to the congo
on july 11 the head of the mineralrich province of katanga moise tshombe announced that his province had seceded from the country
confusion became chaos
each succeeding day brought new acts of violence
lumumba and kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the belgians and appealed to the united nations to send troops to oust them
on july 14 the security council with france and great britain abstaining voted the resolution which drew the un into the congo
vague in wording it called for withdrawal of belgian troops and authorized the secretarygeneral to take the necessary steps to provide the congolese government with such military assistance as may be necessary until through the efforts of the congolese government with the technical assistance of the united nations the national security forces may be able in the opinion of the government to meet fully their tasks

secretarygeneral hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the un troops sent into the congo were to come from african or at least nonwhite nations certainly not from the us russia great britain or france
he quickly called on ghana tunisia morocco guinea and mali which dispatched troops within hours
ultimately the un army in the congo reached a top strength of 19000 including about 5000 from india and a few soldiers from eire and sweden who were the only whites
it took the un three months to bring a modest form of order to the congo
the belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed un efforts
the wildly erratic nature of patrice lumumba caused constant problems he frequently announced that he wanted the un to get out of the congo along with the belgians and appealed to russia for help
however there is little evidence that the late lumumba was a communist
before appealing to the un or to russia he first appealed to the us for military help and was rejected
lumumba further complicated the uns mission by initiating small wars with the secessionist province of katanga and with south kasai which under albert kalonji wanted to secede as well
meanwhile russia took every opportunity to meddle in the congo sending lumumba equipment for his wars dispatching technicians and even threatening on occasion to intervene openly
but by the end of the threemonth period in october 1960 something approaching calm settled on the congo
president kasavubu became exasperated with lumumba and fired him
lumumba fired kasavubu
control of the government such control as there was and such government as there was passed into the hands of joseph mobutu chief of staff of the congolese army
mobutu promptly flung out the russians who have not since played any significant part on the local scene although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at un headquarters in new york
the belgians at least officially departed from the congo as well withdrawing all of their uniformed troops
but they left behind them large numbers of officers variously called volunteers or mercenaries who now staff the army of moise tshombe in katanga the seceded province which according to tshombe holds 65 of the mineral wealth of the entire country
from october 1960 to february 1961 the un forces in the congo took little action
there was no directive for it the security councils resolution had not mentioned political matters and in any case the united nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation whether to unify it federalize it or balkanize it
during the fivemonth lull civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the congo
in february the murder of patrice lumumba who had been kidnaped into katanga and executed on order of tshombe again stirred the un to action
on feb 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the congo including the use of force if necessary in the last resort
although the resolution might have been far more specific it was considerably tougher than the earlier one
it also urged that the un eject and prevent the return of all belgian and other foreign military and political advisers
ordered an investigation of lumumbas death
urged the reconvention of the congolese parliament and the reorganization of the army
the presidency talking and listening
though president john f kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of berlin and disarmament adviser mccloys unexpected report from khrushchev his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of us foreign policy last week
high up on the presidents priority list was the thorny question of bizerte
on this issue the president received a detailed report from his un ambassador adlai stevenson who had just returned from paris and mr kennedy asked stevenson to search for a facesaving way for both paris and tunis out of the imbroglio
ideally the president would like the french to agree on a status quo ante on bizerte and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the mediterranean base
to continue their important conversations about the tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems mr kennedy invited stevenson to cape cod for the weekend
the president also discussed the bizerte deadlock with the no 2 man in the tunisian government defense minister bahi ladgham who flew to washington last week to seek us support
the conversation apparently convinced mr kennedy that the positions of france and tunisia were not irreconcilable
through ladgham mr kennedy sent a message along those lines to tunisian president habib bourguiba
and one us official said the key question now is which side picks up the phone first
on the latin american front the president held talks with secretary of the treasury douglas dillon before sending him to uruguay and the interamerican economic and social council which the president himself had originally hoped to attend
main purpose of the meeting to discuss president kennedys alliance for progress
and that was not all
in conferences with nationalist chinas dapper diminutive vice president chen cheng mr kennedy assured chiang kaisheks emissary that the us is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of red china to the united nations
chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of outer mongolia
however the president who would like to woo the former chinese province away from both peking and moscow would promise chen nothing more than an abstention by the us if outer mongolias admission comes to a vote
the president also conferred with emissaries from guatemala and nepal who are seeking more foreign aid
to africa he sent his most trusted adviser his brother attorney general robert kennedy on a goodwill mission to the ivory coast
all week long the president clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs
in effect he was practicing what he preached in his berlin message two weeks ago when he declared we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk and listen with reason
crime skyjacked
from international airport in los angeles to international airport in houston as the great fourjet boeing 707 flies is a routine five hours and 25 minutes including stopovers at phoenix el paso and san antonio
when continental airlines nightcoach flight 54 took off at 1130 one night last week there was no reason to think it would take any longer
the plane put down on schedule at 135 am in phoenix
thirtyone minutes later when it took off for el paso hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teenage boy who had come aboard
at 357 am with the plane about twenty minutes out of el paso passenger robert berry a san antonio advertising man glanced up and saw the man and boy accompanied by a stewardess walking up the aisle toward the cockpit
the man was bent over with his hand on his stomach berry said
i figured he was sick
john salvador a farmer from palm desert calif was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit
the kid had a automatic like they issue in the army he said
the other fellow had a
salvador saw the youth hold his against the head of stewardess lois carnegey
the man put his at the head of capt byron d rickards
to rickards a 52yearold veteran 30 years in the air it was an old story his plane was being hijacked in midflight again much as it had happened in 1930 when peruvian rebels made him land a ford trimotor at arequipa
but last weeks pirates like the cubanamerican who recently hijacked an eastern airlines electra newsweek aug 7 wanted to go to havana
stalling
tell your company there are four of us here with guns the elder man told rickards
the pilot radioed el paso international airport with just that message
but he told the skyjackers the 707 didnt carry enough fuel to reach havana
they would have to refuel at el paso
most passengers didnt know what had happened until they got on the ground
jerry mccauley of sacramento calif one of some twenty air force recruits on board awoke from a nap in confusion
the old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to cuba mccauley said and like a nut i raised my hand
i thought he was the air force recruiter
what the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages along with the crew
they chose four jack casey who works for continental airlines in houston
fred mullen from mercer island wash
pfc truman cleveland of st augustine
fla and leonard gilman a former college boxer and veteran of the us immigration service border patrol
everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at el paso at 418 am
they found a large welcoming group el paso policemen border patrol sheriffs deputies and fbi men who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns
other fbi men talking with the pilot from the tower conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to havana
the ground crew which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes took fully three hours
still more time was consumed while the pilot at the radioed suggestion of continental president robert six tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the boeing jet for a propellerdriven douglas aj
actually the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane
they had orders to that effect straight from president kennedy who thought at first as did most others that it was four followers of cubas fidel castro who had taken over the 707
mr kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane kept in touch throughout by telephone
at one time while still under the impression that he was dealing with a cuban plot the president talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with cuba
as the morning wore on and a blazing west texas sun wiped the shadows off the franklin mountains police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment
from the luggage they learned that the two air pirates far from being cubans were native americans subsequently identified as leon bearden 50yearold exconvict from coolidge ariz and his son cody 16 a highschool junior
tension
the heat and strain began to tell on the beardens
the father by accident or perhaps to show as he said we mean business took the and fired a slug between the legs of second officer norman simmons
at 730 am more than three hours after landing the beardens gave an ultimatum
take off or see the hostages killed
the tower cleared the plane for takeoff at 8 am and captain rickards began taxiing toward the runway
several police cars loaded with armed officers raced alongside blazing away at the tires of the big jet
the slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines
the plane slowed to a halt
ambulances baggage trucks and cars surrounded it
the day wore on
at 1250 pm a ramp was rolled up to the plane
a few minutes later fbi agent francis crosby talking fast eased up the ramp to the plane unarmed
while crosby distracted the beardens stewardesses carnegey and toni besset dropped out of a rear door
so did hostages casey cleveland and mullen
that left only the four crew members crosby and border patrolman gilman all unarmed with the beardens
the elder bearden had one pistol in his hand the other in a hip pocket
gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance
he caught officer simmons eye nodded toward young bearden and i swung my right as hard as i could
simmons and crosby jumped the boy and it was all over
frogmarched off the airplane at 148 pm the beardens were held in bail of 100000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines
bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to castro and live high in cuba
back home in coolidge ariz his 36yearold wife mary said i thought they were going to phoenix to look for jobs
congress more muscle
taking precedence over all other legislation on capitol hill last week was the military strength of the nation
the senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass 85 to 0 the largest peacetime defense budget in us history
with the money all but in hand however the administration indicated that instead of the 225000 more men in uniform that president kennedy had requested the armed forces would be increased by only 160000
the holdback as pentagon mutterers labeled it apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and thus the new funds spent prudently
in all the senate signed a check for 467 billion which not only included the extra 35 billion requested the week before by president kennedy but tacked on 754 million more than the president had asked for
the senate on its own decided to provide additional b52 and other longrange bombers for the strategic air command
the house which had passed its smaller appropriation before the presidents urgent call for more was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order
in other areas congressional action last week included
the senate by voice vote and the house by 224170 passed and sent to the white house the compromise farm bill which the president is expected to sign not too unhappily
the senate also voted 52 billion to finance the governments health welfare and labor activities
debate on the allimportant foreignaid bill with its controversial longrange proposals had just begun on the senate floor at the weekend
white house legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact
food stew a la mulligatawny
most members of the us senate because they are human like to eat as high on the hog as they can
but because they are politicians they like to talk as poormouth as the lowliest voter
as a result ever since 1851 when the senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the capitol building the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food even while they opposed every move that might improve it
over the years enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of maine and idaho potatoes the menu has pursued its drab allamerican course
individual senators with an eye to the voters back home occasionally introduced smelts from michigan softshell crabs from maryland oysters from washington grapefruit from florida
but plain old bean soup served daily since the turn of the century at the insistence of the late sen fred dubois of idaho made clear to the citizenry that the senates stomach was in the right place
in a daring stroke the senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a 10000peryear frenchborn maitre dhotel
holders of tollroad bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes
longterm trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward
higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues
result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative
things are looking up these days for many of the state turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their tollroad bonds
traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing
that added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates
as a result of the new outlook for turnpikes investors who bought tollroad bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments
another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these taxexempt bonds
other taxexempt bonds of state and local governments hit a price peak on february 21 according to standard poors average
on balance prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then
however in the same threemonth period tollroad bonds as a group have bucked this trend
on these bonds price rises since february 21 easily outnumber price declines
taxfree returns
investors however still see an element of morethanordinary risk in the tollroad bonds
you find the evidence of that in the chart on this page
many of the tollroad bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent or very close to that
and this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to or beyond the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds
that 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds
its not much more in fact than the return that is offered on u s treasury bonds
for investors whose income is taxed at high rates though a taxfree yield of 4 per cent is high
it is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than 16000 of income to be taxed or for a married couple with more than 32000 of taxed income
swelling traffic
a new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12month period ending in february or march shows what is happening
the report is based on a survey by blyth company investment bankers
nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period
and there is the bright note the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession
many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter
indication the longterm trend of turnpike traffic is upward
look for example at the ohio turnpike
traffic on that road slumped sharply in january and february as compared with those same months in 1960
then march brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues after operating costs
as a result the roads net revenues in the 12 months ending march 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds
that was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months
that same pattern of earnings shows up on the massachusetts turnpike
operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 but up for the 12 months ending in march
costs were held down despite a bitter winter
for the year the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs against 121 per cent in the preceding period
the roads engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into boston
slow successes
some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do
the 187mile illinois state toll highway for example was not opened over its entire length until december 1958
in the 12 months ended in february 1960 the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load with the remainder paid out of initial reserves
in the 12 months ended in february 1961 this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest
that improvement is continuing
in the first two months of 1961 earnings of the illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960
success for many turnpikes has come hard
traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers rosy estimates
in these cases the turnpike managements have had to turn to tollrate increases or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways
many rate increases already have been put into effect
higher tolls are planned for july 1 1961 on the richmondpetersburg va turnpike and proposals for increased tolls on the texas turnpike are under study
easier access
progress is being made too in improving motorists access to many turnpikes
the kansas turnpike offers an illustration
net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended feb 28 1961
further improvements in earnings of the kansas turnpike are expected late in 1961 with the opening of a new bypass at wichita and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both kansas city kans and kansas city mo
meanwhile there appears to be enough money in the roads reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years
for some roads troubles
investors studying the tollroad bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals
traffic and revenues on the chicago skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike
if nothing is done the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962
west virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months and despite recent improvement in revenues holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same
these however are exceptions
the typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement
its going to take time for investors to learn how many of the tollroad bonds will pay out in full
already however several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins
many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the breakeven point
a top american official after a look at europes factories thinks the us is in a very serious situation competitively
commerce secretary luther hodges accompanied by a member of our staff on may 10 toured plants of two of italys biggest companies fiat the auto producer and olivetti maker of typewriters and calculating machines
our staff man cabled from turin as follows
follow secretary hodges through the fiat plant and you learn this
one modern equipment much of it supplied under the marshall plan enables fiat to turn out 2100 cars a day
about half of these are exported
two wage costs are a fraction of the us costs
a skilled worker on the assembly line for example earns 37 a week
three labor troubles are infrequent
fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years
said secretary hodges its a tough combination for the us to face
olivetti had a special interest for hodges
olivetti took over underwood the us typewriter maker in late 1959
within a year without reducing wages underwoods production costs were cut one third prices were slashed
the result has been that exports of underwood products have doubled
the olivetti plant near turin has modern layout modern machinery
the firm is designconscious salesconscious advertisingconscious
hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the us
the inflow of foreign capital would help the us balance of payments
hodges predicted i think we will see more foreign firms coming to the us
there are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas
foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports
the recently unveiled kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for american businessmen in many lines
important aspects of the kennedy textile plans are these
an international conference of the big textileimporting and textileexporting countries will be called shortly by president kennedy
chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting
the us will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the lessdeveloped countries over the years
point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first need encouragement to get on their feet
if they have trouble exporting international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would
idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible
at the same time another purpose of the conference will be to get certain lowwage countries to control textile exports especially dumping of specific products to highwage textileproducing countries
japan since 1957 has been voluntarily curbing exports of textiles to the us
hong kong india and pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to britain for several years under the lancashire pact
none of these countries is happy with these arrangements
the japanese want to increase exports to the us while they have been curbing shipments they have watched hong kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big us market
hong kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to britain while spanish and portuguese textiles pour into british market unrestrictedly
the indians and pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the british market for similar reasons
the kennedy hope is that at the conference or through bilateral talks the lowwage textileproducing countries in asia and europe will see that dumping practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas
gradual controlled expansion of the worlds textile trade is what president kennedy wants
this may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products
its an important clue to washington thinking
note too that the kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the us textile industry
get competitive or get out
in veiled terms thats what the kennedy administration is saying to the american textile industry
the government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines where modernization doesnt seem feasible
special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed
government research will look into new products and methods
import quotas arent ruled out where the national interest is involved
but the kennedy administration doesnt favor import quotas
rather they are impressed with the british governments success in forcing and helping the british textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products
whats happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from lowwage countries
among the highestpaid workers in the world are us coal miners
yet us coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers mouths water
steel company of wales a british steelmaker wants to bring in virginia coal cut down on its takings of welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively especially in foreign markets
virginia coal delivered by ship in wales will be about 280 a ton cheaper than welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines
us coal is cheap despite high wages because of widespread mechanization of mines wide coal seams attactive rates on ocean freight
many of the coal seams in the nationalized british mines are twisting narrow and very deep
productivity of us miners is twice that of the british
welsh coal miners communistled are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in american coal
they threaten to strike
the british government will have to decide whether to let us coal in
the british coal industry is unprofitable has large coal stocks it cant sell
every library borrower or at least those whose taste goes beyond the fivecent fiction rentals knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically im sorry but we dont have that book
there wouldnt be much demand for it im afraid
behind this reply and its many variations is the everpresent budget problem all libraries must face from the largest to the smallest
what to buy out of the years grist of nearly 15000 book titles
what to buy for adult and child readers for lovers of fiction and nonfiction for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified when your budget is pitifully small
most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate
a startlingly high percentage do not exceed 500 annually which includes the librarians salary and not even the new york public has enough money to meet its needs this in the worlds richest city
the plight of a small community library is proportionately worse
confronted with this situation most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds
in some parts of the country however a cooperative movement has begun to grow under the wing of state governments whereby with the financial help of the state libraries share their book resources on a countywide or regional basis
new york state has what is probably the most advanced of these cooperative systems so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow
because it is so large a state with marked contrasts in population density the organization of the new york cooperative offers a crosssection of how the plan works
at one extreme are the systems of upper new york state where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large sparsely populated area
at the other are organizations like the newly formed nassau library system in a highdensity area with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve
both these types and those in between are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at albany as early as 1950 with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state
it was a step in the right direction but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today
under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts
an earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not as they saw fit
some library boards are wary of the plan
a large wellstocked library surrounded in a county by smaller ones may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great
a small library may cherish its independence and established ways and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board
within a system however the autonomy of each member library is preserved
the local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program facilities and services but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system
all services are given without cost to members
so obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of new york state now has access to a system and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day not too distant when all the libraries in the state will belong to a coop
to set up a cooperative library system the law requires a central book collection of 100000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus and the system is organized around it
the collection may be in an existing library or it may be built up in a central collection
each system develops differently according to the area it serves but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency
the basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita if a library spends a certain number of dollars
in nassau county for example the heavily settled long island suburb of new york city the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons a figure that has doubled since 1950
this system by virtue of its variety and size offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation
the nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area
the need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries adequate to satisfy everyday needs could afford
nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its hempstead headquarters which will reach its goal of 100000 volumes by 1965
the major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers
basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection but there is also specialization in science and technology an indicated weakness in local libraries
on microfilm headquarters also has a file of the new york times from its founding in 1851 to the present day as well as bound volumes of important periodicals
the entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans
headquarters gets about 100 requests every day
it is connected by teletype with the state library in albany which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide
the books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries
each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area which headquarters could then build upon
east meadow has philosophy psychology and religion
freeport houses social science pure science and language
history biography and education are centered in hempstead
levittown has applied science business and literature
while hewlettwoodmere is the repository of art music and foreign languages
the reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service
this kind of cooperation is not wholly new of course
public libraries in nassau county have been lending books to each other by mail for a quartercentury but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis
local libraries find too that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library
the system passes on these savings to its members
further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing
books are not the only resource of the system
schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary art and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs and to organizations in member communities
the most recent film catalogue available at each library lists 110 titles presently in the collection any of which may be borrowed without charge
this catalogue lists separately films suitable for children young adults or adults although some classics cut across age groups such as nanook of the north the emperors nightingale and the red balloon
workshops are conducted by the systems audiovisual consultant for the staffs of member libraries teaching them the effective use of film as a library service
the system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together
consequently an experienced childrens librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote wellplanned library activities cooperating with the childrens librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences workshops and frequent visits
headquarters has also set up a central juvenile bookreview and bookselection center to provide better methods of purchasing and selection
sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups
story hours preschool programs activities with community agencies and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the childrens consultant
headquarters of the nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days threatening to expand beyond its boundaries
in addition to the interlibrary loan service and the childrens program headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county
it prepares cooperative displays posters booklists brochures and other promotional material for use in member libraries
it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used
and it publishes sum and substance a monthly newsletter which reports the systems activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries
the system itself is governed by a board of trustees geographically representing its membership
in nassau as in other systems the longrange objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools and on adult education in general
librarians a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication can begin to see results today
library use is multiplying daily and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned americans the teenagers
to them especially the librarians with the help of coops hope they will never have to say im sorry we dont have that book
today more than ever before the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned
the great advances made in recent years in communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the western world
the need for lifetime reading is apparent
education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives for it is only through knowledge that we as a nation can cope with the dangers that threaten our society
the desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life
we cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read
if we are not discriminating in our reading
if we do not know how to use what we do read
we must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word
a fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries
although progress has been made in americas system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed america
the problem grows in intensity each year as mans knowledge and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word continue to expand
the inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition
there are for example approximately 25000000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50000000 with inadequate service
in college libraries 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1509 institutions surveyed last year by the us office of education
and over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all
in every aspect of service to the public to children in schools to colleges and universities the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services
only public understanding and support can provide that service
this is one of the main reasons for national library week april 1622 and for its theme for a richer fuller life read
assembly session brought much good
the general assembly which adjourns today has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day it convened
it was faced immediately with a showdown on the schools an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education
there followed the historic appropriations and budget fight in which the general assembly decided to tackle executive powers
the final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information they need
longrange planning of programs and ways to finance them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid crisistocrisis government
this session for instance may have insured a financial crisis two years from now
in all the turmoil some good legislation was passed
some other good bills were lost in the shuffle and await future action
certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law the school bills the increase in teacher pensions the ban on drag racing acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city limits repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue
no action has been taken however on such major problems as ending the fee system penal reform modification of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks sales
only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state
the legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations questions
fortunately it spared us from the usual spate of silly resolutions which in the past have made georgia look like anything but the empire state of the south
we congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation
in the interim between now and next year we trust the house and senate will put their minds to studying georgias very real economic fiscal and social problems and come up with answers without all the political heroics
league regularly stands on the side of right
the league of women voters 40 now and admitting it proudly is inviting financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive
its a good use of money
these women whose organization grew out of the old suffrage movement are dedicated to thomas jeffersons dictum that one must cherish the peoples spirit but keep alive their attention
if once they become inattentive to the public affairs jefferson said you and i and congress and assemblies judges and governors shall all become wolves
newspapermen and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs
the league workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and make them available to the public
the harder the choice the more willing the league is to wade in
and the league takes a stand with great regularity on the side of right
look to coosa valley for industrial progress
cities and counties interested in industrial development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled toward the 13 northwest georgia counties that are members of the coosa valley area planning and development commission
coupling its own budget of 83750 with a 30000 state grant authorized by gov vandiver the group expects to sign a contract in march with georgia tech
then a fulltime planning office will be established in rome to work with a fivemember georgia tech research staff for development of an area planning and industrial development program
the undertaking has abundant promise
it recognizes the fact that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding together in an areawide effort better results can be accomplished than through the goitalone approach
rusk idea strengthens united states defense
the rusk belief in balanced defense replacing the dulles theory of massive retaliation removes a grave danger that has existed
the danger lay not in believing that our own abombs would deter russias use of hers
that theory was and is sound
the danger lay in the american delusion that nuclear deterrence was enough
by limiting american strength too much to nuclear strength this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war besides a nuclear war
this strategy heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear war
it also weakened our diplomatic stance because russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear war except in the ultimate extremity
this left the soviets plenty of leeway to start lowgrade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity
by maintaining the nuclear deterrent but gearing american military forces to fight conventional wars too secretary of state rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more muscle and greater safety into our military position
dekalb budget shows county is on beam
dekalbs budget for 1961 is a record one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance
it includes a raise in the county minimum wage creation of several new jobs at the executive level financing of beefedup industrial development efforts and increased expenditures for essential services such as health and welfare fire protection sanitation and road maintenance
that such expansion can be obtained without a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners headed by chairman charles o emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust he was given was well placed and other county officials
somewhere somebody is bound to love us
g mennen williams is learning the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly
touring africa the new us assistant secretary of state observed africa should be for the africans and the british promptly denounced him
then he arrived in zanzibar and found africans carrying signs saying american imperialists go home
chin up soapy
power company backs confidence with dollars
confidence in the states economic future is reflected in the georgia power companys record construction budget for this year
the firm does a large amount of research and its forecasts have meaning
it is good to know that georgia will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of industrialization
georgias mental health program received a badly needed boost from the general assembly in the form of a 1750000 budget increase for the milledgeville state hospital
actually it amounts to 1250000 above what the institution already is receiving considering the additional halfmillion dollars gov vandiver allocated last year from the state surplus
either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money and is
but exactly how far it will go toward improving conditions is another question because there is so much that needs doing
the practice of charging employes for meals whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished
the work week of attendants who are on duty 65 hours and more per week should be reduced
more attendants nurses and doctors should be hired
patients deserve more attention than they are getting
even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal year georgia will be spending only around 315 per day per patient
the national average is more than 4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental health field to be too low
kansas regarded as tops in the nation in its treatment of the mentally ill spends 9 per day per patient
georgia has made some reforms true
the intensive treatment program is working well
but in so many other areas we still are dragging
considering what is being done compared to what needs to be done it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning toward making the best possible use of the increase granted
the boost is helpful but inadequate
the end of trujillo
assassination even of a tyrant is repulsive to men of good conscience
rafael trujillo the often bloodthirsty dictator of the dominican republic for 31 years perhaps deserved his fate in an evenhanded appraisal of history
but whether the murder of el benefactor in ciudad trujillo means freedom for the people of the caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered
trujillo knew a great deal about assassination
the responsibility for scores of deaths including the abduction and murder of jesus maria galindez a professor at columbia university in new york has been laid at his door
he had been involved in countless schemes to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such as president romulo betancourt of venezuela
it was a sort of poetic justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the venezuelan government reportedly involving the use of dominican arms by former venezuelan dictator marcos perez jimenez has been uncovered and quashed
the recent history of the dominican republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive
unquestionably trujillo did some good things for his country he improved public facilities such as roads and sanitation attracted industry and investment and raised the standard of living notably
but the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition
el benefactors vanity grew with his personal wealth
the jails were filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his displeasure
he maintained amply financed lobbies in the united states and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise and his influence extended even to congress
until the last year or so the profession of friendship with the united states had been an article of faith with trujillo and altogether too often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character
tardily the government here came to understand how this countrys own reputation was tarnished by the association with repression
last year after trujillo had been cited for numerous aggressions in the caribbean the united states and many other members of the organization of american states broke diplomatic relations with him
thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines
trujillos dictatorship had been along conservative rightwing lines
but after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing communist slogans
there was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with castro in cuba previously a bete noire to trujillo thus illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces
what comes after trujillo is now the puzzle
the dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation and all alternative leadership has been suppressed
perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger
the dominican republic could turn toward communisttype authoritarianism as easily as toward western freedom
such a twist would be a tragedy for the dominican people who deserve to breathe without fear
for that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the dominican republic will need the greatest sympathy and help
start on rapid transit
highspeed buses on the george washington memorial parkway operating between downtown washington and cabin john glen echo and brookmont would constitute an alluring sample of what the new national capital transportation agency can do for this city
in presenting plans for such express buses before the montgomery county council the administrator of the ncta c darwin stolzenbach was frankly seeking support for the projects his agency will soon be launching
such support should not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the ncta are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown area
because the buses would not stop on the parkway land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed
the ncta is well advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of congress
must berlin remain divided
the inference has been too widely accepted that because the communists have succeeded in building barricades across berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that living city
so far as the record is concerned the western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so
though walter ulbricht by grace of soviet tanks may be head man in east germany that does not give him any right to usurp the government of east berlin or to absorb that semicity into the soviet zone
the wartime protocol of september 12 1944 designated a special greater berlin area comprising the entire city to be under joint occupation
it was not a part of any one of the three later four zones for occupation by soviet american british and french troops respectively
after the berlin blockade and airlift the council of foreign ministers in 1949 declared a purpose to mitigate the effects of the present administrative division of germany and of berlin
for some time the communists honored the distinction between the soviet zone of germany and the soviet sector of berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas
then they moved offices of the east german puppet government into east berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of east germany
that this and the closing of the east berlinwest berlin border have not been accepted by the western governments appears in notes which britain france and the united states sent to moscow after the latters gratuitous protest over a visit of chancellor adenauer and other west german officials to west berlin
the chancellor had as much business there as ulbricht had in east berlin and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile soundtruck taunts of gerhard eisler
the british and other replies to that moscow note pointed out efforts of the communist authorities to integrate east berlin into east germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital of east germany
they insisted on the fundamental fact that the whole of berlin has a quadripartite status
this is far from acknowledging or recognizing those efforts as an accomplished fact
there remains of course the question of what the west can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts
one ground of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over into west berlin as communist vopos try to gun down fleeing unarmed residents
another remained when an american army car was recovered but with a broken glass
the glass may seem trivial but communist official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed
remembering the stepbystep fate of danzig and the west german misgivings about salami tactics it is to be hoped that the dispatch of general clay to west berlin as president kennedys representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed
prairie national park
thousands of buffalo bison they will never be to the man on the street grazing like a mobile brown throwrug upon the rolling dustygreen grassland
a horizon even and seamless binding the vast sunbleached dome of sky to earth
that picture of the american prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest of the american continent as any later cinema image of the west made in liveoak canyons near hollywood
for it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of americans the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the ohio and mississippi valleys began to fill
the national park service now proposes to preserve an area in pottawatomie county northeast kansas as a prairie national park
there the buffalo would roam to be seen as a tapestry not as motheaten zoo specimens
wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved
grasslands would extend unfenced unplowed unbroken by silo or barn as the first settlers saw them
the park service makes an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new park
american history should clinch the case when congress is asked to approve
whisky on the air
a philadelphia distiller is currently breaching the customary prohibition against hardliquor advertising on tv and radio
starting with small stations not members of the national association of broadcasters the firm apparently is seeking to break down the antiliquor barriers in majormarket stations
probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional action requiring the federal communications commission to ban such advertising through its licensing power
the national association of broadcasters code specifically bars hardliquor commercials
past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this policy
even the distilled spirits institute has long had a specific prohibition
why then with these voluntary barricades and some state laws barring liquor ads is it necessary to seek congressional action
simply because the subverting action of firms that are not members of the distilled spirits institute and of radio and tv stations that are not members of the nab tends to spread
soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of noncode competitors
although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly no more fatuous than the pseudosophistication with which tv softdrinks are downed or toothpaste applied there is a sad difference between enticing a viewer into sipping oopsiecola and gulling him into downing bourbon
a law is needed
new york democrats choice
registered democrats in new york city this year have the opportunity to elect their partys candidates for mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization
in the central contest that for mayor they may have found some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other
mayor robert f wagner must as his opponents demand assume responsibility for his performance in office
while all citizens share in blame for lax municipal ethics the wagner regime has seen serious problems in the schools law enforcement and fiscal policies
the mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record
state controller arthur levitt on the other hand cannot effectively deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than in the citys welfare
they too have links with the citys ills
both men are known to be honest and publicspirited
mayor wagners shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed than those of mr levitt who left an impression of quiet competence in his more protected state post
as mayor mr levitt might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters would like
his election on the other hand would unquestionably strengthen the regulars
mr wagner might or might not be a new mayor in this third term now that he is free of the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls bosses
these are of course the same people whose support he has only now rejected to seek the independent vote
but his reelection would strengthen the liberal democrats and the labor unions who back him
if this choice is less exciting than new york democrats may wish it nevertheless must be made
the vote still gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party
little war big test
both mr ks have so far continued to speak softly and carry big sticks over laos
president kennedy already two quiet demands down still refused thursday to be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to moscow
but at the same time he moved his helicopterborne marines to within an hour of the fighting
and secretary rusk en route to bangkok doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of australian or thai seato forces
for mr kennedy speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation
the new president is in no position to start out his dealings with moscow by issuing callable bluffs
he must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says
in this case he has put the alternatives clearly to mr khrushchev for the third time
at his press conference mr kennedy said all we want in laos is peace not war a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn
at the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position
since laos is of no more purely military value to moscow itself than it is to washington this approach might be expected to head off mr khrushchev for the moment
but because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in laos the soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride a course that would appear to cost him little on the spot but would bog washington in a tactical mess
as wars go laos is an extremely little one
casualties have been running about a dozen men a day
the hard core of the procommunist rebel force numbers only some 2000 tough viet minh guerrilla fighters
but for the united states and its seato allies to attempt to shore up a less tough less combattested government army in monsoonshrouded roadshy guerrillathwisp terrain is a risk not savored by pentagon planners
but if anything can bring home to mr khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watching this braddockagainsttheindians contest it will probably be the fact that seato forces are ready to attempt it plus the fact that moscow has something to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with washington
fortunately both the republicans and americas chief western allies now are joined behind the neutral laos aim of the president
actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the british policy of seeking to achieve a neutral laos via the international bargaining table
it is ironic that washington is having to struggle so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable
the state department tacitly rejected the neutral laos idea after the geneva conference of 1954 and last year washington backed the rightist coup that ousted neutral premier souvanna phouma
but since last fall the united states has been moving toward a proneutralist position and now is ready to back the british plan for a ceasefire patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of interested powers
the road to a guaranteedneutral coupproof laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nations terrain
but for the safety of southeast asia and for the sake of the laotian people who would not be wellruled by either militant minority now engaged in the fighting this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war had to be made
the world awaits mr khrushchevs choice of alternatives
a vote for educational tv
the senates overwhelming 6413 vote to support locally controlled educational tv efforts should be emulated in the lower house
twice previously the senate has approved measures backing etv and the house has let them die
but this year prospects may be better
the house communications subcommittee is expected to report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds
this years senate measure would provide each state and the district of columbia with 1000000 to be used in support of private state or municipal etv efforts
the funds would be used for equipment not for land buildings or operation
the relatively few communities that have educational stations have found them of considerable value
but lacking money from commercial sponsors the stations have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service
other communities the ones to be aided most by the senate bill have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment
a good man departs
goodby mr sam

sam rayburn was a good man a good american and third a good democrat
he was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure
mr speaker mr sam and mr democrat at one and the same time
the house was his habitat and there he flourished first as a young representative then as a forceful committee chairman and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth speaker of the house and second most powerful man in washington
mr rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label
he was no flaming liberal yet the new deal the fair deal and the new frontier needed him
he was not a rearlooking conservative yet partisans of that persuasion will miss him as much as any
two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word
sam rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave for he was never loquacious and his word once given was not subject to retraction
it might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs
the demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical
his leadership was not for audiences
a growl a nod was usually enough
when it was not one of the great dramas of washington would be presented
he would rise in the well of the house his chin upon his chest his hands gripping the side of a desk and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence
he spoke briefly sensibly to the point and without oratorical flourishes
he made good plain american common sense and the house usually recognized it and acted upon it
these public efforts were rare because mr rayburn normally did his counseling persuading and educating long before an issue reached its test on the house floor
he expected democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them
with his long service he had a long memory an excellent thing in a political leader
he was of course in the house for a very long time
there are only two men remaining in congress who with rayburn voted for the declaration of war against germany in 1917
to almost two generations of americans it must have seemed as though the existence of mr sam coincided with that of the house
and it was the house he loved
to be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition
the senate to him was not the upper body and he corrected those who said he served under the president
he served with him
sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death
woodrow wilson with whom he began his years in washington warren g harding calvin coolidge fdr with whom he managed a social revolution
and those still with us herbert c hoover harry s truman dwight d eisenhower and john f kennedy
he was a fighter for those of his own party
mr truman has only to recall the hopeless campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of mr kennedy with congress would have been sadder than it was had not mr sam been there
as it was his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration
with republican presidents he fought fair
he was his own man not an automatic obstructionist
he kept his attacks on republicanism for partisan campaigns but that is part of the game he was born to play
under any name mr speaker mr democrat mr sam he was a good man
un off the congo track
thirteen italian airmen who went to the congo to serve the cause of peace under the united nations banner have instead met violent death at the hands of congolese troops supposedly their friends
in 18 months no more grisly incident has been reported from that jungle
simply out of bloodlust their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river
the excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the italians for belgian mercenaries
in other words atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central government might be condoned had the victims been serving the cause of dissident katanga
does this suggest that the congo is fit for nationhood or that un is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making it
to the contrary through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence
mass rapes troop mutinies uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures given no sanction by any political authority have become almost daily occurrences
yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of katanga
it happens in the territory of the leopoldville government which is itself a fiction demonstrably incapable of governing and commanding only such limited credit abroad as un support gives it
the main question raised by the incident is how much longer will un bury its head in the sand on the congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms
the probable answer is that it will do so just as long as russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young african nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on central africa
right now they are pushing a resolution which would have un use its forces to invade and subjugate katanga
that notion is fantastically wrongheaded from several points of view
the un army is too weak too demoralized for the task
further it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned
last it makes no sense to deliver katanga the one reasonably solid territory into the existing chaos
the congo should have been mandated because it was not ready for independence
the idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed over wisdom
it is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism
but if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the general assembly it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach
otherwise un will march blindly on to certain defeat
featherbed reversal
a recent editorial discussing a labormanagement agreement reached between the southern pacific co and the order of railroad telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information
the editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year
our comment was that this was featherbedding in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement
the statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life
additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need
also normal personnel attrition would make the job reduction provision more or less academic
the situation with regard to the southern pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries
the solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands
meditations from a fallout shelter
time was when the house of delegates of the american bar association leaned to the common sense side
but the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar and when the lads met in st louis it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the united nations was scarcely less than wonderful despite an imperfection here and there
it was the brief writers decided mans best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world
peace its wonderful and world law its wonderful too and shouldnt we get an international covenant extending it into space before the russians put some claim jumper on the moon
meanwhile in moscow khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of tnt to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who cant see the justice of surrendering west berlin to communism
a nuclear pacifier of these dimensions roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the united states has triggered experimentally would certainly produce a bigger bang and just for kicks khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from st louis to the moon where there wouldnt even be any beer to drink
while he was at it the philosopher of the kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who cant appreciate coexistence thru suicide
fools he bayed what do you think you are doing
the only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we arent playing the marimba with our shoes in the united nations but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort
another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from mexico city with the daily hijacking of an american plane by a demented algerian with a gun
the craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to havana where for some unknown reason castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the colombian foreign minister a passenger who is not an admirer of old ten oclock shadow
the plane was sent back to the united states for a change but castro kept the crazy gunman who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution
less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by castros right hand man che guevara who edified the interamerican economic and social council meeting in montevideo by reading two secret american documents purloined from the united states embassy at caracas venezuela
the contents were highly embarrassing to american spokesmen who were on hand to promise latin americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium
perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing american diplomatic papers and planes but the kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that but for its own incompetence in protecting american interests these things would not happen
the same can be said about the halfhearted cuban invasion mounted by the administration last april which we trust is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious khrushchev
pass the iron rations please and light another candle for its getting dark down here and were minded to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away
the customer loses again

the board of suspension of the interstate commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain as they had planned to do this month
the request for lower rates originated with the southern railway which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a 100ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional smaller car
by reducing rates as much as 60 per cent it and its associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have lost to truckers and barge lines
the boards action shows what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws
a shock wave from africa
word of dag hammarskjolds death in an african plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe
as head of the united nations he was the symbol of world peace and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously
it was on the eve of a momentous un session to come to grips with cold war issues
his firm hand will be desperately missed
mr hammarskjold was in africa on a mission of peace
he had sought talks with moise tshombe the secessionist president of congos katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody
he earnestly urged a ceasefire
the story of the fatal crash is not fully known
the unchartered plane which was flying from the conference city of ndola in northern rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was newly repaired
whether this or overt action was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined
the death of mr hammarskjold removes the united nations most controversial leader
he was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice
he courageously defended the rights of small nations and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the communist bloc
the congo in whose cause he died was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs
his policies had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war and workable solutions were beginning to take shape
when the recent katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions mr hammarskjold despite the danger flew to exert a calming influence
he gave his life for his beliefs
the un session scheduled for today will meet under the cloud of his passing
it is a crucial session with the world on the edge of momentous developments
if the manner of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason and justice
that is the hope of mankind
monument to togetherness
reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community has long been one of greater miamis hardest tasks
too many have bogged down in bickering
even when public bodies arrived at a consensus at least one dissenting vote has been usual
so we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity
all nine members of the interamerican center authority voted for goodbody companys proposal to finance the longawaited trade and cultural center
the widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms of its contract
if the indenture is accepted the authority will proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue
then goodbody will hand over a minimum of 155 million for developing the spacious graves tract to house the center
the next step awaits approval today by the metro commissioners as the members of the dade county port authority
they allotted 500000 three years ago to support interama until its own financing could be arranged
less than half the sum has been spent since the interama board pinched pennies during that period of painstaking negotiations
the balance is being budgeted for the coming year
unanimity on interama is not surprising
it is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone is agreed
the city of miami recently yielded a prior claim of 85 million on the graves tract to clear the way for the project
county officials have cooperated consistently
so have the peoples elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels
interama as it rises will be a living monument to greater miamis ability to get together on worthwhile enterprises
a short report and a good one
progress or lack of it toward civil rights in the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689page compilation issued last week by the united states commission on civil rights
much happened in this field during the past 12 months
each state advisory committee documented its own activity
some accounts are quite lengthy but floridas is the shortest of all requiring only four paragraphs
the established pattern of relative calm in the field of race relations has continued in all areas reported this group headed by harold colee of jacksonville and including two south floridians william d singer and john b turner of miami
no complaints or charges have been filed during the past year either verbally or written from any individual or group
the committee continues to feel that florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights
problems have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most cases with understanding and restraint
the progress reported by the advisory committee is real
while some think we move too fast and others too slowly floridas record is a good one and stands out among the 50
west germany remains western
west germany will face the crucial tests that lie ahead on berlin and unification with a coalition government
this is the key fact emerging from sundays national election
chancellor adenauers christian democratic party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough to lose the absolute bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957
in order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gained strength
inevitably this means some compromise
the aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired
both willy brandts social democrats who gained 22 seats in the new parliament and the free democrats who picked up 23 will insist on that before they enter the government
moonfaced ludwig erhart the economic expert probably will ascend to the leadership long denied him
if he becomes chancellor dr erhart would make few changes
the wizard who fashioned west germanys astonishing industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise
he is dedicated to building the nations strength and as are all west germans to a free berlin and to reunion with captive east germany
what is in doubt as the free germans and their allies consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result
if the party of adenauer and erhart with 45 per cent of the vote approaches the party of willy brandt which won 36 per cent the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve
west berlins mayor brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his city and won votes by it
the free democrats 12 per cent of the vote believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the soviet union and more dealings with the communist bloc
the question left by the election is whether west germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility
it could go either way since the gains for both points of view were about the same
regardless of the decision two facts are clear
west germany with its industrial and military might reaffirmed its democracy and remains firm with the free nations
and the career of konrad adenauer who upheld germanys tradition of rocklike leaders which bismarck began draws near the end
better ask before joining
americans are a nation of joiners a quality which our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing
but it can be dangerous if the joiner doesnt want to make a spectacle of himself
for instance socalled conservative organizations some of them secret are sprouting in the garden of joining where liberal organizations once took root
one specific example is a secret fraternity which will coordinate anticommunist efforts
the principle is commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get gulled
according to the chicago tribune news service state atty gen stanley mosk of california has devised a series of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization seeking his money and his name 1
does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations
2
does it attack other traditional american institutions with unsupportable and wild charges
3
does it put the label of unamerican or subversive on everyone with whom it disagrees politically
4
does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming american statesmen for wars communism depression and other troubles of the world
5
does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing campaigns
6
do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the principles they purport to advocate
in some instances a seventh question can be added 7
does the organization show an affinity for a foreign government political party or personality in opposition or preference to the american system
if the wouldbe joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions of americans in a troubled time
falling somewhere in a category between einsteins theory and sand fleas difficult to see but undeniably there nevertheless is the tropical green city of islandia a string of offshore islands that has almost no residents limited access and an unlimited future
the latter is what concerns us all
whatever land you can see here from the north tip end of elliott key looking southward belongs to someone people who have title to the land
and what you cant see the land underneath the water belongs to someone too
the public
the only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the abovewater land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment
in the fairly brief but hectic history of florida the developers of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours
in this instance happily insistence is being made that our share is protected
and until this protection is at least as concrete as say the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at miami beach those who represent us all should agree to nothing
closed doors in city hall
the reaction of certain city council members to californias newest antisecrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing
we had assumed that at least this local legislative body had nothing to hide and therefore had no objections to making the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available to the public
in the preamble to the openmeeting statutes collectively known as the brown act the legislature declares that the public commissions boards and councils and other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the peoples business
it is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly
the people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them
the people in delegating authority do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know
the full implementation of these noble words however has taken the efforts of five sessions of the legislature
since 1953 california has led the nation in enacting guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted but not until this year did the lawmakers in sacramento plug the remaining loopholes in the brown act
despite the lip service paid by local governments the antisecrecy statutes have been continuously subverted by reservations and rationalizations
when all else fails it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations
we submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law and one of its principal aims
without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily
but the citizens would of course never be sure that the decisions that resulted were as correct as they were expeditious
help when needed
if the dominican republic achieves free democratic government it will be due in large part to the us show of force that enabled president balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of trujillo dictatorship
outwardly ciudad trujillo is calm
none of the trujillo family remains
mr balaguer is in control and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring
had us warships not appeared off the dominican coast there is every possibility that the country would now be wracked by civil war
ultimately either the trujillos would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a takeover by dominican elements responsive to castro in cuba
within the organization of american states there may be some criticism of this unilateral american intervention which was not without risk obviously
but there was no complaint from the dominican crowds which lined ciudad trujillos waterfront shouting vive yankees
more the us action was hailed by a principal opposition leader dr juan bosch as having saved many lives and many troubles in the near future
mr balaguers troubles are by no means over
he will need the help of all oas members to eradicate finally the forces of authoritarianism protrujillo and procastro alike
in cooperating toward that objective oas might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the united states
matter of survival
those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in 1935
now as then it is a matter of jobs
craft unions seek work that industrial unions claim such as factory maintenance
the issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the american federation of labor of its industrial union members
that breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the american federation of labor and the congress of industrial organizations
or thats what it looked like at the time
but automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs
walter reuther leader of the industrial union faction of the aflcio says another two years of this squabbling will be disastrous for all american labor
whether it could be as disastrous for american labor as say jimmy hoffa of the teamsters is a matter of conjecture
but the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craftindustrial rivalry do not win friends for labor
engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival this country can have little patience with labors family feuds
the concept of labor as a special class is outmoded and in the task confronting america as bastion of the free world labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive
deterrent
the army navy and air force among others may question secretary freemans claim that the high estate of united states agriculture is the strongest deterrent to the spread of communism
but the secretary insists that the success of the american farmer is the greatest single source of strength in the struggle to insure freedom around the world
mr freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by americas capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production or even by the soviets successes in space
this shouldnt surprise the secretary
american taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long long time
in fact over the years the american farmers capacity to overproduce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar
and thus far mr freeman has offered very little relief
the 1961 feed grain program which the secretary sponsored has been declared a billion dollar fiasco
in exchange for higher price supports growers pledged reduction in planted acreage
but the farmers outsmarted washington by shortening the distance between the rows and pouring on the fertilizer
the result 11 billion added to the deficit in the federal budget
perhaps as mr freeman says american agriculture may stop the communists but it is also swindling the american taxpayer
whats wrong at state
a senate subcommittee headed by sen jackson of washington has been going over the state department and has reached some predictable conclusions
the department needs a clearer sense of direction at the top and it needs fewer but better people sen jackson says
the subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department
president kennedy has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance
but those who would revitalize so complex an organization must first of all overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes
nor does sen jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the white house of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign policy
this tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for secretary rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates
but competent observers believe he is making progress particularly toward what sen jackson lists as the primary need a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them
the jackson report will provide some of the political support mr rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel engaged as sen jackson puts it in work that does not really need doing
mr rusk should also draw comfort from sen jacksons recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved
selfcriticism is a rare but needed commodity in congress
betting men
forecasting economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist
but now apparently the job of secretary of labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends
james p mitchell when he was the head of the department promised to eat his hat if unemployment didnt drop below three million a couple of years ago
he lost but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora
his successor secretary goldberg also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months
no betting man mr goldberg says hes merely putting my neck out again by predicting the rate will go down this month
he is basing his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened its stride a new record high in personal income an increase in housing starts a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable goods
mr mitchell had an excuse for losing the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated
mr goldberg has less reason for missing
the economy seems to be sailing along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an end so they cant be blamed in november
the odds thus appear favorable that the secretarys neck may be spared
little resistance
cambodias chief of state who has been accused of harboring communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for neighboring south viet nam and thailand insists he would be very unhappy if communism established its power in southeast asia
but so convinced of communisms inevitable triumph is prince sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel
i have to see the facts is the way the prince puts it
and from that point of vantage he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a prowestern posture
prince sihanouks powers of prognostication some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions
bottom sighted
commerce secretary hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official washingtons economic forecasters
weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues in the cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement
recently treasury secretary dillon and labor secretary goldberg fell into line with mr hodges appraisal though there has been some reluctance to do so at the white house
and now mr hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point
he is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump
the secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales
februarys volume was 1 per cent above januarys for the first pickup since last october although its still 15 per cent off from february 1960
corroborating mr hodges figures was the federal reserve boards report of the large sales increase in the nations department stores for the week ending march 4
in newark for example this gain was put at 26 per cent above the yearearlier level
of course some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960
another optimistic sign this one from the labor department was the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payments was interrupted for the first time in the week ending feb 25
initial claims for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8100 in the week ending march 4
mr hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he doesnt think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes
well we cant have everything
prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut
in new jersey too
new jersey folk need not be told of the builders march to the sea for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that remain
now the stone harbor bird sanctuary 31 acres of magic attraction for exotic herons is threatened but the battlefront extends far beyond our state
against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation of 30 miles of cape cod shoreline the tiny tract at stone harbor may seem unimportant
but interior secretary udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves
the move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30000 acres of cape cod from provincetown to chatham is strengthened by president kennedys interest in that area
but preservation of the natural beauty of the cape is of more than regional concern for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all over the country
by comparison stone harbor bird sanctuarys allies seem less formidable for aside from the audubon society they are mostly the snowy common and cattle egrets and the louisiana green little blue and blackcrowned herons who nest and feed there
but there is hope for conservation commissioner bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its park space
the desirability of preserving such places as the cape dunes and stone harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every year
public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is growing
but that heritage is shrinking even faster
no joyride
much of the glamor president kennedys peace corps may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by sargent shriver the head corpsman
anybody who is expecting a joyride should according to mr shriver get off the train right now
first of all the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling
it will be a 16hour training day
then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country where the diet culture language and living conditions will be different
and the pay of course will be nil
despite all this the idea apparently has captured the imagination of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by the response than anybody else
the study of the st louis areas economic prospects prepared for the construction industry joint conference confirms and reinforces both the findings of the metropolitan st louis survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the missouriillinois countryside
st louis sits in the center of a relatively slowgrowing and in some places stagnant midcontinent region
slackened regional demand for st louis goods and services reflects the regions relative lack of purchasing power
not all st louis industries of course have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood
but for those which do the slow growth of the area has a retarding effect on the metropolitan core
the city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate missouri and southern illinois
gov daltons new commerce and industry commission is moving to create a ninestate regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry
that is one approach
another would be to take the advice of dr elmer ellis president of the university of missouri and provide for an impartial professional analysis of missouris economy
he says the state in order to proceed with economic development must develop an understanding of how the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the national economy
the research center of the universitys school of business and public administration is prepared to undertake the analysis dr ellis has been talking about
he and dean john w schwada of the business school outlined the project at a recent conference
the university can make a valuable contribution to the states economic development through such a study
in southern illinois the new federal program of help to economically depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth
the carbondale industrial development corp has obtained a 500000 loan to help defray the cost of remodeling a cityowned factory to accommodate production that will provide 500 new jobs
carbondale is in the herrinmurphysborowest frankfort labor market where unemployment has been substantially higher than the national average
the federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on missouris depressed areas and in the long run that will benefit st louis as well
politicsridden st clair county in illinois presents another piece of the problem of metropolitan development
more industrial acreage lies vacant in st clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the st louis area
the unstable political situation there represents one reason new plants shy away from the east side
and then there is st louis county where the democratic leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth
st louis county under its present leadership also has largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform and permitted parochial interests to take priority over areawide interests
some plantlocation specialists take these signs to mean st louis county doesnt want industry and so they avoid the area and more jobs are lost
metropolitan st louiss relatively slow rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political business civic and other leaders on both sides of the mississippi
without a great acceleration in the metropolitan areas economy there will not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters and st louis will slip into secondclass status
an excess of zeal
many of our very best friends are reformers
still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far
take for example the reformers among new york citys democrats
having whipped mr de sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of tammany hall they have changed the name to chatham hall
even though headquarters actually have been moved into the chatham building do they believe that they can make the new name stick
granted that the tammany name and the tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political shame the sachems of the hall also have a few good marks to their credit
but it is tradition rather than the record which balks at the expunging of the tammany name
after all it goes back to the days in which sedition was not unamerican the days in which the sons of st tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force and violence the british government that is
further do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo
they will when they give up the donkey and the elephant
instead of attempting the impossible why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tigers stripes are not black
that might go over
the faget case
the white house itself has taken steps to remove a former batista official col mariano faget from his preposterous position as interrogator of cuban refugees for the immigration service
the faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds
the kennedy administration had assured anticastro cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates of dictator batista
using a batista man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose castro
moreover col fagets information on cuba was too outdated to be useful in screening castro agents
the colonel fled to the friendly haven of the dominican dictatorship as soon as castro seized power
and while he had headed batistas anticommunist section the batista regime did not disturb the communists so much as more open opponents who were alleged to be communists
responsibility for the faget appointment rests with gen j m swing an eisenhower appointee as head of the immigration service
gen swing has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office
his official term expired last summer
some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend congressman walter of pennsylvania at a moment when the kennedy administration was diligently searching for all the house votes it could get
congressman walter has been allpowerful in immigration matters but he has announced plans to retire in 1962
at that point the administration will have little reason to hang onto gen swing
the faget case was the kind of salvage job the administration should not have to repeat
mr eisenhower politician
as president dwight d eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from the strife of partisan politics
as a former president however mr eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during a new york republican rally and generally missed his target
mr eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost by a peace corps girl in nigeria to attack the entire corps as a juvenile experiment and to suggest sending a corps member to the moon
this was juvenile ridicule
nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the corps or its welcome reception abroad
his words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name to the eisenhower exchange fellowships dedicated to the same goal of international understanding
the former president blithely ignored recent history in speaking of dollarette dollars under kennedy administration fiscal policies
it was the eisenhower administration which produced the largest peacetime deficit
finally mr eisenhower found nothing but confusion in washington
this statement recalls the 1959 berlin crisis when president eisenhower first told reporters that berlin could not be defended with conventional weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the picture too
the crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded
expresidents relieved of accountability for policy sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their words
some of former president trumans offthecuff discourses have been in that vein
nobody can deny the right of former chief executives to take part in politics but the american people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility
